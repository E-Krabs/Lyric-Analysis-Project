[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Outro]
Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe

Wide awake while the world is sound asleepin'
Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreamin'
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you
Every day you try to pick up all the pieces
All the memories, they somehow never leave you
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you
[Chorus]
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows
[Post-Chorus]
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
[Verse 2]
You keep a cover over every single secret
So afraid if someone saw them, they would leave
But somebody, somebody, somebody sees you
Somebody, somebody will never leave you
[Chorus]
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows
[Post-Chorus]
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love

For the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over
Oh, for the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over
'Cause there's a kind of love that God only knows
[Chorus]
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows the real you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love

God only knows where to find you
God only knows how to break through
God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

You are not hidden
There’s never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen

I hear your SOS, your SOS

I will send out an army
To find you in the middle of darkest night
It’s true

Hmm
[Verse 1]
Have you been praying and you still have no answers?
Have you been pouring out your heart for so many years?
Have you been hoping that things would have changed by now?
Have you cried all the faith you have through so many tears?
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget the things that He has done before
And remember He can do it all once more
[Chorus]
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
You're closer than you think you are
Only moments from the break of dawn
All His promises are just up ahead
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it
[Verse 2]
He had the solution before you had the problem
He sees the best in you when you feel at your worst
So in the questioning, don't ever doubt His love for you
'Cause it's only in His love that you'll find a breakthrough, oh
[Chorus]
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe

Only moments from the break of dawn

He is moving with a love so deep
Hallelujah for the victory
Good things are coming even when we can't see
We can't see it yet, but we believe that
He is moving with a love so deep
Hallelujah for the victory
Good things are coming even when we can't see
We can't see it yet, but we believe that

Make it count, leave a mark, build a name for yourself
Dream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else
Make a name the world remembers
But all an empty world can sell is empty dreams
I got lost in the lie that it was up to me
To make a name the world remembers
But Jesus is the only name to remember
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Verse 2]
All the kingdoms built, all the trophies won
Will crumble into dust when it's said and done
'Cause all that really matters
Did I live the truth to the ones I love?
Was my life the proof that there is only One
Whose name will last forever?
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live

Looking back from the other side

Darkest water and deepest pain
I wouldn't trade it for anything
'Cause my brokenness brought me to You
And these wounds are a story You'll use

And I know they'll always tell of who You are

With the strength of Your faithfulness

And hope that your good is good enough
Head down, keep on working

After all it's the least that you can do
But don't buy what they're selling
It couldn't be further from the truth

God helps the ones who help themselves
Press on get it right
Otherwise get left behind

Explain to me what the cross is for

When darkness tries to roll over my bones
When sorrow comes to steal the joy I own
When brokenness and pain is all I know
Oh, I won't be shaken, no, I won't be shaken

Freedom was something I never found
Trying to find 
six feet underground
Under the weight of all of my sin
Fighting the fight that I couldn't win
[Pre-Chorus]
Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe
[Chorus]
I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
Until I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life
[Verse 2]
I look for the words but cannot explain
A new kind of love ran into my veins
You are the key to all of my chains
To all that I was, now I'm not a slave
[Pre-Chorus]
Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe
[Chorus]
I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You

Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life

I have tasted and I've seen the wonders of Your heart
I do not deserve a thing, but that's just who You are
[Chorus]
I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
Until I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
 
(
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown
[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(I keep my head above water, above water)
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
[Bridge]
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep
[Chorus]
So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
[Outro]
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water

This year's felt like four seasons of winter
And you’d give anything you think to feel the sun
Always reaching, always climbing
Always second guessing the timing
But God has a plan, a purpose in this
You are His child and don't you forget
[Chorus]
He put that hunger in your heart
He put that fire in your soul
His love is the reason (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)
To keep on believing (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)
When you feel like giving up
When you feel like giving in
His love is the reason (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)
To keep on believing (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)
[Verse 2]
If we could pull back the curtain of Heaven
We would see His hand on everything
Every hour, every minute
Every second, He's always been in it
Don’t let a shadow of a doubt take hold (Take hold)
Hold on to what you already know
[Chorus]
He put that hunger in your heart (Hunger in your heart)
He put that fire in your soul (Fire in your soul)
His love is the reason (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)

That you can't explain
He's the hope in the heartbreak
The rest in the suffering
He’s closer than the air you breathe
From the start to the end to the in between
Don’t you dare doubt even for a minute
What He started in you, yeah, He's gonna finish
[Chorus]
He put that hunger in your heart (Hunger in your heart)
He put that fire in your soul (Fire in your soul)
His love is the reason (Your love, Your love)

I was dead in my transgressions, wandering in sin
I went searching for redemption down the road that had no end
I was walking through this fire, I was living on the run
With my flesh lost in desire, I was drowning in the flood
[Chorus]
But God
Rich in mercy
You came to save me
Now I'm alive
But God
Strong and mighty
You reached down for me
So I could rise
Now I'm alive
[Verse 2]
I am far from being perfect, there are days that I regret
On this battlefield, I struggle with the lies that I have lived
I have fallen short of glory, I can't make it on my own
If You kept record of my past, I'd been sinking like a stone
[Chorus]
But God
Rich in mercy
You came to save me
Now I'm alive
But God
Strong and mighty
You reached down for me
So I could rise

Now I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I was in the grave, but God You called me out
I'm breathing in (I'm breathing in)
I'm breathing out (I'm breathing out)

There I was on death row
Guilty in the first degree
Son of God hanging on a hill
Hell was my destiny

The crowd was shouting crucify
Could've come from these lips of mine
The dirty shame was killing me
It would take a miracle to wash me clean

Then I read the red letters
And the ground began to shake
The prison walls started falling
And I became a free man that day

My dead heart began to beat
Breath of God filled my lungs

Sent His only Son to die for me
Arms spread wide for the whole wide world
His arms spread wide where mine should be
Jesus changed my destiny

Thank You, God, for red letters
When the ground began to shake
The grace of God started falling
And I became a free man that day
The prison walls started falling

I was running, I was searching
But every place I turned for healing
Left me more broken than the last

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
[Refrain]
And so I’m offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
[Piano Break]

On the nights when the dark last a little bit longer
When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
When the fear in my heart dips a little bit deeper
When my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker
[Pre-Chorus]
Where could I run to?
Where could I go?
[Chorus]
Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take
I know
You never let me go
And even when the waters won't stop rising
Even when I'm caught in the dead of a night
I know
No matter how it ends
You're with me even then
[Verse 2]
When the days up ahead look a little bit brighter
But the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter
I'm reminded Your grace never asks for perfection
Oh I'm restored 'cause I'm Yours and I stand forgiven

Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take

And even when it's hard to remember
You alone are my defense when

You alone are my defense when
I'm standing on Your promises

Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own

They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'

Cripple by burdens like stones on my back
I thought I had fallen too far from your grace
But you came and showed me the way
When I was lost soul searching
You were the ground beneath my feet
When I was blind man begging
You were the eyes so I could see
When the smoke was rising up
You were the air that I could breath
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin

And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor

Wherever I run your leading the way

Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide

Don't let it arrest you
This fear, this fear of fallin' again
And if you need a refuge
I will be right here until the end
Oh, it's time to
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
Burn the ships, cut the ties
Send a flare into the night
Say a prayer, turn the tide
Dry your tears and wave goodbye
[Chorus: Joel and Luke Smallbone]
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
And don't you look back
[Bridge: Joel Smallbone]
So long to shame, walk through the sorrow
Out of the fire into tomorrow
So flush the pills, face the fear
Feel the weight disappear
We're comin' clean, we're born again
Our hopeful lungs can breathe again
Oh, we can breathe again
[Chorus: Joel and Luke Smallbone]
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon our heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
And don't you look back

And don't you look back
And don't you look back

Copy [Verse 1]
It's hard for me to let go, hard for me to breathe
Thinking that I gotta control it all
I can feel my worry and anxiety
When it's slipping through my fingers and I know it
I've been losing my sleep, I've been losing my cool
I can feel my heart go boom, boom, boom
Starin' at the ceiling, feeling like a fool
I'm going under and I know it
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I hear You whisper to me
If I lose my grip I could see
That You are carrying me
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
Oh, 'cause if I trusted, I could move with Your flow
Being carried in the current of Your love
When I lean into Your arms, You're enough
So, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
[Verse 2]
Time for me to let go, time for me to breathe
Knowing that He already holds it all
Time for me to turn down this anxiety
I can know my freedom in a moment
'Cause when I lay it all down, You gonna lift me up
When I pour it all out You gonna fill my cup
You're holding out Your arms and telling me to jump
One, two, three, here I go, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I hear You whisper to me
If I lose my grip I would see
That You're always carrying me
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
Oh, 'cause if I trusted, I could move with Your flow
Being carried in the current of Your love
When I lean into Your arms, You're enough
So, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
[Bridge]
Letting go of my worries (Letting go of my worries)
For my need to control things (For my need to control things)
I'm gonna take You at Your word and (I'm gonna take You at Your word)
I'm gonna lay down all my burdens (All my burdens)
Letting go of my worries (Letting go of my worries)
For my need to control things (For my need to control things)
I'm gonna take You at Your word and
I'm gonna lay down all my burdens (All my burdens)

Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
[Verse 2]
Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
[Chorus]
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
[Post-Chorus 1]
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
[Verse 3]
And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way
[Chorus]
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
[Post-Chorus 2]
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
[Chorus]
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now

Let me tell you, all my friends
About this joy I'm living in
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take the mic, go on and testify
How I was dead and then I came to life
No more living in the dark of night
Now everything's alright
[Chorus]
I've been changed, I've been saved
Brand new day
I've been changed, I've been changed
Tell me why would I turn back now?
There's no end to the love I've found
Future's bright and there ain't no doubt
I've been changed, I've been changed
[Verse 2]
All my heartbreak fades away
Like a book when you turn the page

Let me take the mic, go on and testify
How I was dead and then I came to life
No more living in the dark of night
Now everything's alright

Brand new day
I've been changed, I've been changed
Tell me why would I turn back now?

Future's bright and there ain't no doubt
I've been changed, I've been changed

Woo-oh, I've been changed

I put my hands in the air
'Cause I know You're there (Your love, it's something magical)
I put my hands in the air
'Cause You heard my prayer (A transformation radical)
I put my hands in the air
'Cause I know You're there (I know it's supernatural)
I put my hands in the air
'Cause You heard my prayer (wooh wooh wooh)
[Chorus]
I've been changed, I've been saved (I can feel it now)
Brand new day (I believe it)
I've been changed, I've been changed (Oh, I believe)
Tell me why would I turn back now? (I can feel it now)
There's no end to the love I've found (wooh wooh wooh)
Future's bright and there ain't no doubt

God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is
[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

That's what God is

What will it be like when my pain is gone
And all the worries of this world just fade away?
What will it be like when You call my name
And that moment when I see You face to face?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm waiting my whole life to hear You say
[Chorus]
Well done, well done
My good and faithful one
Welcome to the place where you belong
Well done, well done

You have run the race and now you're home
Welcome to the place where you belong

And every broken thing will finally be made whole?

Standing in the presence of a love so beautiful?

I will live my life to hear You say

Waiting my whole life for that day
Until then I'll live to hear You say

There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
[Verse 2]
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way, I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body and now that power lives in me
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
[Bridge]
I can see the light in the darkness, as the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens, as the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us, as the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us, nothing stands between us
[Verse 3]
There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There'll be another in the fire, standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, how good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle, 'cause I know that's where You'll be
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
'Cause there is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

All I did was stay still, stay still
[Chorus: Francesca Battistelli & Steffany Gretzinger]
Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
Hallelujah, great Defender
So much better Your way
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Francesca Battistelli & Steffany Gretzinger]
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
[Chorus: Francesca Battistelli & Steffany Gretzinger]
Hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better this way
Hallelujah, great Defender
So much better Your way
So much better Your way (I know it's so much better)
So much better Your way (I know it, I know it)
[Outro: Francesca Battistelli & Steffany Gretzinger]
And all I did was praise
All I need to do is worship
Lord, I will just bow down
I'm just gonna stay still

Copy [Verse 1]
The other day, I was thinking to myself
Made a list of all my mistakes
Oh, I wish I could've run to you
And tell you all about my heartbreak
And I wondered to myself "Wait a minute
Am I even on the right path now?"
Had a couple wins, but I got knocked down
But I know if you were still around, you would say
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end
[Chorus]
You gotta get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Verse 2]
And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be
And even though in a moment
I know anything can change
You're perfect plans might fall apart
But the simple truth remains
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end
[Chorus]
You gotta get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Bridge]
'Cause you've only got one life
And you don't know when it ends
You've only got one heart
So get out there and live
Yeah, you've only got one life
Don't let it get away
Everyone falls down
But you can get up, up again
[Chorus]
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Outro]
And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be

Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God
(Somebody pray for me)

Kanye West

I deserve all the criticism you got
If that's all the love you have, that's all you got
To sing of change
, you think I'm joking
To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

Copy [Verse 1]
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the 
King of Kings
[Verse 2]
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
[Verse 3]
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
[Verse 4]
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Praise forever to the King of Kings

Now that my heart's been found
Nothing really feels the same
I hold my head a bit higher
I lift my voice a bit louder
Yeah, something inside has changed

'Cause I've been set free
I am a gospel preacher, heart on fire
Freedom singing, testifier
'Cause I've been redeemed
I am a believer
I am a believer

I know I don't walk alone
No matter what comes my way
I have peace through the trouble
I have joy though the struggle
And now my hope's in a brighter day

I was down on my luck, I was stuck
I was running 'round broken-hearted
I was sinking so fast
I couldn't last falling apart

And You could've ran away
Leaving me there in my shame
Leaving me fighting my pain
But You made a better way
Oh, ohh, ohhh

Goodbye to the sinner, I'm held by the Father above
No more shame
Called out of the desert and drowned in the power of love
Amazing grace, my soul set free
Ain't no grave got a hold on me
I'm born again, born again
Washed by the water, I'm clean

You're showing me all of my life in a new light
Every step, every breath

Leaving me fighting my pain

A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows

Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes

But that's when love says you're mine

My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful

That God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now

How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night

Tore through the shadows of my soul

Jesus Christ, my living hope

What heart could fathom such boundless grace?

To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Verse 3]
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Jesus, Yours is the victory, whoa!
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope...
[Outro]
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Oh God, You are my living hope

If I were You I would've given up on me by now
I would've labeled me a lost cause
'Cause I feel just like a lost cause
If I were You I would've turned around and walked away
I would've labeled me beyond repair
'Cause I feel like I'm beyond repair
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but somehow You don't see me like I do
Somehow You're still here
[Chorus]
You're the God who stays
You're the God who stays
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands
With wide open arms
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays
[Verse 2]
I used to hide
Every time I thought I let You down
I always thought I had to earn my way
But I'm learning You don't work that way
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause somehow You don't see me like I do
Somehow You're still here
[Chorus]
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands (You're the God who stands)
With wide open arms (With wide open arms)
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays
[Bridge]
My shame can't separate
My guilt can't separate
My past can't separate
I'm Yours forever
My sin can't separate
My scars can't separate
My failures can't separate
I'm Yours forever
No enemy can separate
No power of hell can take away
Your love for me will never change
I'm Yours forever
[Chorus]
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands (You're the God who stands)
With wide open arms (With wide open arms)
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays
You're the God who stays
You're the one who runs in my direction

I've been strong
And I’ve been broken within a moment
I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend
I’ve held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath
[Verse 2]
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
[Chorus]
And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me
[Verse 3]
Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious
And I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing
And still You want my heart
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
You wear the scars
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
[Chorus 2]
And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It’s a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me

You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

When the past it comes to haunt me
It tells me what I've done, it reminds me what's gone wrong
When my sins are laid before me
My Lord, You take them on, yes, my Lord, You take them on

I will trust Your mercy is
Greater than all of this

Greater than all my regrets

You are
Greater than all my regrets
You are, You are

Driftin' beneath the horizon
Body is weak, but I’m tryin'
To make it to shore, but I'm fallin’ short

Bound for the gallows
A dead man walking
'
Til love came calling
Rise up

This beating heart, these open eyes

O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side
[Verse 2]
O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply
[Pre-Chorus 1]
In the highlands and the heartache
You’re neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find
[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
[Verse 3]
O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past
[Verse 4]
O how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side
[Pre-Chorus 2]
For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
[Bridge]
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent
My song of ascent
[Pre-Chorus 3]
From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave
[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

Why God
Do people have to die
A daughter or a son
Sudden and so young
Long before their time?
[Verse 2]
Why God
Do people fall apart
A promise and a ring
Becomes a broken thing
A road that got too hard?
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't understand
But I understand
[Chorus 1]
Why God I need You
It's why God I run to Your arms
Over and over again
It's why God I cling to Your love
And hold on for dear life
And I find You are right by my side
[Verse 3]
Why God
Do we feel so alone?
Every single day
Fighting through the pain
Hoping there is hope

I don't understand

Why God I need You
It's why God I run to Your arms

Give me a faith stronger than I have
I need to know when it hurts this bad
That You hold my heart when it breaks
And I'm not alone in this place

That's why God I need You
Why God I run to Your arms
Over and over again
It's why God I cling to Your love
And hold on for dear life
And I find You are right by my side
Always right by my side
Even here in the why... God

Telling me it's ok, come just as you are
I never heard a melody, like the one that's singing over me
And I just wanna sing along, 'cause mercy is a song

Freedom is a choir, swaying back and forth
Shining in the shadow of a stain glassed Sunday morning
Shouting hallelujah, yesterday is gone
Oh freedom is a choir and mercy is a song

No matter where you've been just come on home
Let all God's children sing along
Hallelujah chains are gone

Guilty is a lie, spoken by a thief
Saying after what you've done, you don't deserve to be free

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Had as much of you as I can take
I'm so done, so over being afraid

And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here

Take a minute, let it settle in
You probably never saw it coming
Something's gotta give so I give up you, oh

In case you didn't hear it
Here it is again

Sing the words of the wise and the young
Show me the place where your words come from

Feel your heartbeat bang the drum
Open up your eyes and fill your lungs
The same word from where the stars were flung
Love's the language, love's your native tongue

To find a way to use our lungs for love and not the shadows
I want the world to sing in her native tongue
To sing it like when we were young
Back before the pendulum had swung to the shadows
I want the world to sing in her native tongue
Maybe we could learn to sing along

You look 'til You find it
You search to find me
[Chorus 2]
What have I done to deserve love like this?
What have I done to deserve love like this?
I cannot earn what You so freely give
What have I done to deserve love like this?
[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
[Chorus 2]
What have I done to deserve love like this?
What have I done to deserve love like this?
I cannot earn what You so freely give
What have I done to deserve love like this?

Copy [Verse 1]
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow
And I stand face to face with the enemy
I will know that I am not forsaken
You surround me when the fire's at my feet
[Chorus]
You're my defender
You fight for me
I will remember
You're all I need
You are my healer
My remedy
Against the power of the unknown
And I will not stand alone
'Cause You're my defender
[Verse 2]
I can see You when the night is closing in
And I will trust You when it seems that there's no hope
And I hold tight to the promise You have given
'Cause this I know and I am confident
[Chorus]
You're my defender
You fight for me
I will remember
You're all I need
You are my healer
My remedy
Against the power of the unknown
And I will not stand alone
'Cause You're my defender
You're my defender
[Bridge]
I'm saved by the blood
I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
I'm saved by the blood
I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
I'm saved by the blood
And I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
I'm saved by the blood
And I'm saved...
[Chorus]
'Cause You're my defender
You fight for me
I will remember
You're all I need
And You are my healer
My remedy
Against the power of the unknown
And I will not stand alone
'Cause You're my defender
[Post-Chorus]
I know that You are for me
I know You will not fail
The weapons formed against me
Cannot prevail because...
[Outro]
I'm saved by the blood
I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
I'm saved by the blood
I'm saved by the blood of Jesus
'Cause You're my defender

Copy [Verse 1]
I've carried a burden for too long on my own
I wasn't created to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
You saw my condition, had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart
And I don't have a context for that kind of love
I don't understand, I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh…
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh… (Oh-ohh)
[Bridge]
My heart has been in Your sights
Long before my first breath
Running into Your arms
Is running to life from death
And I feel this rush deep in my chest
Your mercy is calling out
Just as I am You pull me in
And I know I need You now
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
And my heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh…
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Again and again

Copy [Verse 1: NEEDTOBREATHE]
I won't pretend
That we can control the night
Or what kind of road we're on
Or where we will see the light
But right now I'm talking to ya
I'm looking into your eyes
Right now I'm trying to show ya
That we're gonna be alright
[Pre-Chorus: NEEDTOBREATHE]
Oh I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh all I know
Is that my love
It knows no end
[Chorus: NEEDTOBREATHE & JOHNNYSWIM]
All these pieces they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
'Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry you every time
Because I'm forever on your side
Oh I'm forever on your side
[Verse 2: NEEDTOBREATHE 
w/ Amanda Ramirez
]
They'll beat you up
But don't let 'em keep you down
You're always tough enough
And I'll always be around
[Bridge: NEEDTOBREATHE & JOHNNYSWIM]
Oh I can't promise that a day will never come
Where the ground beneath us falls out and you got nowhere to run
Oh but you won't be alone when the water starts to rise up
No you won't be alone my darling when the rains come
