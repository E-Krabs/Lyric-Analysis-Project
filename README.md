# Lyric-Analysis-Project

This was a project for my jesus-y math/data analysis class. These scripts get the most used word for a specified word in Billboard's Top 100 Christian songs.
They all sound the same. So, I wanted to see what words are used the most. You can change the script to scrape any other genre of music. Hope these scripts can be repurposed
