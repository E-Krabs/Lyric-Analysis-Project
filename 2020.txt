[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Outro]
Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
 
(
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

Sometimes on this journey, I get lost in my mistakes
What looks to me like weakness is a canvas for Your strength
And my story isn't over, my story's just begun
Failure won't define me 'cause that's what my Father does
Yeah, failure won't define me 'cause that's what my Father does
[Chorus]
Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door (Ooh)
'Cause it ain't welcome anymore (Ooh)
Ooh, you're in the Father's house
[Verse 2]
Arrival's not the end game, the journey's where You are
You never wanted perfect, You just wanted my heart
And the story isn't over, if the story isn't good
A failure's never final when the Father is in the room
A failure's never final when the Father is in the room
[Chorus]
Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door (Ooh)
'Cause it ain't welcome anymore (Ooh)
Ooh, you're in the Father's house, yeah
You're in the Father's house, yeah-yeah
[Bridge]
Prodigals come home
The helpless find hope
Love is on the move
When the Father's in the room
Prison doors fling wide
The dead come to life
Love is on the move
When the Father's in the room
Miracles take place
The cynical find faith
And love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room
The Jericho walls are quakin'
Strongholds now are shakin'
Love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room
Love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room

Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door (Ooh)

Are you disappointed? Are you desperate for help?
You know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself
Well, you start to believe you don't have what it takes
'Cause it's all you can do just to move much less finish the race

But don't forget what lies ahead

Almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home
[Verse 2]
Well, this road will be hard, but we win in the end
Simply because of Jesus in us, it's not if, but when
So take joy in the journey, even when it feels long
Oh, find strength in each step knowing Heaven is cheering you on

We are almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home

Almost home, almost home
[Bridge]
I know that the cross has brought Heaven to us
But make no mistake, there's still more to come
When our flesh and our bone are no longer between
Where we are right now and where we're meant to be
When all that's been lost is made whole again
When these tears and this pain no longer exist
No more walking, we're running as fast as we can
Consider this our second wind

Almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home

I've been thinking about time and where does it go
How can I stop my life from passing me by, I don't know
I've been thinking about family (Family), how it's going so fast
Will I wake up one morning, just wishing that I could go back?
I've been thinking about lately, maybe I could make a change
And then it could change me, so with all of my heart
This is my prayer
[Chorus]
Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Keep me in the moment, oh keep me in the moment
Keep me in the moment, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me
[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the morning, Lord touch my heart
Don't let me stray, I just wanna stay where You are
All I got is one shot, one try, one go around in this beautiful life
Nothing is wasted when everything's placed in Your hands
[Chorus]
Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)

It's hard to take for a moment more
We've got to
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
Burn the ships, cut the ties
Send a flare into the night
Say a prayer, turn the tide
Dry your tears and wave goodbye
[Chorus: Joel and Luke Smallbone]
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
And don't you look back
[Verse 2: Luke Smallbone]
Don't let it arrest you
This fear, this fear of fallin' again
And if you need a refuge
I will be right here until the end
Oh, it's time to

We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
And don't you look back
[Bridge: Joel Smallbone]
So long to shame, walk through the sorrow
Out of the fire into tomorrow
So flush the pills, face the fear
Feel the weight disappear
We're comin' clean, we're born again
Our hopeful lungs can breathe again
Oh, we can breathe again
[Chorus: Joel and Luke Smallbone]
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
Step into a new day
We can rise up from the dust and walk away
We can dance upon our heartache, yeah
So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships

You don't answer all my questions
But You hear me when I speak
You don't keep my heart from breakin'
But when it does, You weep with me
You're so close that I can feel You
When I've lost the words to pray
And though my eyes have never seen You
I've seen enough to say
[Chorus]
I know that You are good
I know that You are kind
I know that You are so much more
Than what I leave behind
I know that I am loved
I know that I am safe
'Cause even in the fire to live is Christ, to die is gain
I know that You are good
[Verse 2]
I don't understand the sorrow
But You're calm within the storm
Sometimes this weight is overwhelming
But I don't carry it alone
You're still close when I can't feel You
I don't have to be afraid
And though my eyes have never seen You
I've seen enough to say
[Chorus]
I know that You are good
I know that You are kind
I know that You are so much more

On my darkest day, from my deepest pain
Through it all, my heart will choose to sing Your praise
On my darkest day, from my deepest pain
Through it all, my heart will choose to sing Your praise
On my darkest day, in my deepest pain
Through it all, my heart will choose to sing Your praise

I've been running in circles
Jumping the hurdles
Getting caught in that rush of doing so much
I'm feeling kinda worn out
All this checking the boxes
Trying to be flawless
Has me spinning my head, catching my breath
Too afraid to slow down

I tell myself to keep this up
That God wants more than just my love
But I've been complicating things
It's just like me to overthink
[Chorus]
Gotta keep it real simple, keep it real simple
Bring everything right back to ground zero
'Cause it all comes down to this
Love God and love people (People)
We're living in a world that keeps breakin'
But if we want to find a way to change it
It all comes down to this
Love God and love people

The keys to the Kingdom (Hey)
Knowing life will be found when love can be loud

There I was empty-handed
Crying out from the pit of my despair
There You were in the shadows
Holding out Your hand You met me there

And now where would I be without You?
Where would I be, Jesus?
[Chorus]
You were the voice in the desert
Calling me out in the dead of night

Lifted me up from the ashes
Carried my soul from death to life
Bringing me from glory to glory
You are my rescue story

You were louder than my shame

Where would I be, Jesus?

This is the story of a runaway
With no way home and no way out
I threw the best of me away
I had my chance, it's too late now
Too far gone and too ashamed
To think that You'd still know my name
But love refused to let my story end that way
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst
Love moved first
Oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-ohh
[Verse 2]
What kind of grace, relentless grace
Would chase this rebel down
Crawl into this prisoner's cage
Take my hand and pull me out
You knew I couldn't make the change
So You became the change in me
And now I live to tell the story
Of the God who rescues
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst
Love moved first
[Bridge]
From the throne to the manger
From a manger to the grave
Your cross is the proof
Love made the first move
From a grave meant to keep You
To a stone rolled away
Your cross is the proof
Love made the first move
I remember where You found me
I'm amazed by where I stand
Your cross is the proof
That love made the first move
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst
Love moved first
Oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Love moved first

My heart is breaking
In a way I never thought it could
My mind is racing
With the question, "are you still good?"
[Pre-Chorus]
Can you make something
From the wreckage?
Would you take this heart
And make it whole again?
[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok"
[Verse 2]
I've blamed myself
And if I'm honest, maybe I've blamed you too
But You would not forsake me
'Cause only good things come from You
[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok"

From beginning to the end
You're so close
You have never let me down
And you won't
In the valley, in the shadow, I know
You're so close
You're so close
[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It’s gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok”

It’s gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
I'm gonna be ok, I'm gonna be ok

There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
[Verse 2]
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way, I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body and now that power lives in me
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
[Bridge]
I can see the light in the darkness, as the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens, as the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us, as the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us, nothing stands between us
[Verse 3]
There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There'll be another in the fire, standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, how good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle, 'cause I know that's where You'll be
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
'Cause there is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Everybody hurts sometimes
I know that's what they say
But right now it seems this loneliness won't go away
Can anybody feel this heartache?
Is anyone around?
Feels like we're running 'round in circles
We can't catch a breath
We can't always enjoy the moment
When we always want what's next
Just when I can't take no more
It's when I hear You say
[Chorus]
Don't hang your head when you get lonely
No, I'll never leave your side
And don't go thinking you're the only

In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the 
King of Kings
[Verse 2]
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
[Verse 3]
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
[Verse 4]
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one

Praise forever to the King of Kings

You are my hope, my song, Jesus
Before my heart knows what to pray
You've already made a way, Je-eee-sus
[Chorus]
You've been my Savior,  Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again
My Mother and my Father, Brother, Sister, and Friend
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
You've been my Savior, Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again

You're the only answer to the darkness
You're the only right among the wrong
You're the only hope among the chaos
You are the voice that calls me on
[Pre-Chorus]
Louder than every lie
My sword in every fight
The truth will chase away the night

Your name is power over darkness
Freedom for the captives
Mercy for the broken and the hopeless
Your name is faithful in the battle
Glory in the struggle
Mighty, it won't let us down or fail us
Your name is power (Power)
Your name is power, hey (Power)
Hey, yeah

Yes, I know You speak the power to prevail

Light arrives and Heaven opens

We believe that change is coming
Holy Spirit, let us see it

Glory in the struggle
Mighty, it won't let us down or fail us

Freedom was something I never found
Trying to find 
six feet underground
Under the weight of all of my sin
Fighting the fight that I couldn't win
[Pre-Chorus]
Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe
[Chorus]
I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
Until I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life
[Verse 2]
I look for the words but cannot explain
A new kind of love ran into my veins
You are the key to all of my chains
To all that I was, now I'm not a slave
[Pre-Chorus]
Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe

I was a dead man walking

God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted 
Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up
 (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

Ooh-ooh-ooh (Like You love me, like You love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Like You love me, like You love me)
[Verse 1]
Always something trying to steal my mood
My crazy thoughts trying to kill my groove
That's when I hear a voice, whisper through the noise
That brings a bigger picture into view
[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever the clouds come into my mind
I won't forget it's You who tells the sun to shine
Every worry, every night
Every second thought about tomorrow's wasted time
[Chorus]
You give the sparrows everything they need
You light the stars and You paint the leaves, aye
You clothe the lilies with Your majesty
And You don't even love 'em like You love me
No, You don't love 'em like You love me, no

Ooh-ooh-ooh (Like You love me, oh, like You love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Like You love me, eh, like You love me)

That You would choose to set Your eyes on me?
It blows my mind to think, that You would know my name
And I'm adored by the King of Kings

Whenever the clouds come into my mind
I won't forget it's You who tells the sun to shine
Every worry, every night

Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre
[Verse]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

And You've never seemed so far away

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

I heard you say it's overwhelming
I said I'd never be too far

Woke up 'cause the light poured in
Day two, let the flood begin
Day one left me in my bed (In my bed)
I can barely remember it
Heart shattered in a thousand ways
They tell me pain gonna come in waves
They tell me I'm gonna be okay
I'm still waitin' for the first to break

Why would You give and then take him away?
Suddenly end, could You not let it fade?
What I would give for a couple of days
A couple of days

Is it just across the Jordan?
Or a city in the stars?
Are you singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart
[Verse 2]
I just can't make sense of this
Everything is so dissonant
Somebody said he was meant for this
But I'm just straight missin' him
I wanna wake up to your laugh at two
Catch you when you steal my shoes
Say good mornin', afternoon
Talk you through those "Alex blues" (Alex blues)
Listen to your latest beats
Talk about what the lyrics mean
Venmo you another loan (Another loan)
See you do your second show
[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd turn, you would turn it around (Turn it around)
Thought that you had time to straighten it out (Straighten it out)
Told me that you were my prodigal son
But this isn't home
[Chorus]
Is it just across the Jordan?
Or a city in the stars?
Are you singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart
[Bridge]
Did he see You from a long way off (Did he see you?)
Runnin' to him with a father's heart? (Runnin' to him)
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Did he see You from a long way off
Runnin' to him with a father's heart?
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Are you singin' with the angels?

Lie number one: You're supposed to have it all together
And when they ask how you're doing, just smile and tell them "Never better"
Lie number two: Everybody's life is perfect except yours
So keep your messes and your wounds and your secrets safe with you behind closed doors
[Pre-Chorus]
But truth be told, the truth is rarely told (No)
[Chorus]
I say, "I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine, oh, I'm fine, hey, I'm fine"
But I'm not, I'm broken
And when it's out of control, I say "It's under control"
But it's not and You know it
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it
When being honest is the only way to fix it
There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
So let the truth be told
[Verse 2]
There's a sign on the door, says, "Come as you are," but I doubt it
'Cause if we lived like that was true, every Sunday morning pew would be crowded
But didn't You say church should look more like a hospital?
A safe place for the sick, the sinner and the scarred, and the prodigals
Like me
[Pre-Chorus]
Well truth be told, the truth is rarely told
Oh, am I the only one who says
[Chorus]
"I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine, oh, I'm fine, hey, I'm fine"
But I'm not, I'm broken (Broken)
And when it's out of control, I say "It's under control"
But it's not and You know it (Know it)
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it
When being honest is the only way to fix it
There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
So let the truth be told
[Bridge]
Can I really stand here unashamed
Knowing that Your love for me won't change?
Oh God, if that's really true
Then let the truth be told
[Chorus]
I say, "I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine, oh, I'm fine, hey, I'm fine"
But I'm not, I'm broken (Broken)
And when it's out of control I say it's under control
But it's not and You know it (Know it)
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it
When being honest is the only way to fix it
There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
Yeah, I  know
There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
So let the truth be told

Lost your way, lost your cool
Then you straight up lost your mind
Tried so hard to stay ahead
But you keep falling behind
Life is gonna pull you down
Make it hard to see
But a little change in your point of view
Could be just what you need
[Chorus]
There's always a reason to always choose joy
There's something deeper that the world can't destroy
Smile, when you think you can't
Smile, get up and dance
Smile, there's a bigger plan
The storm only lasts for a while
So smile
[Verse 2]
Happiness is wonderful
But it doesn't stick around
Walkin' on sunshine
Then here come the clouds
You can laugh or you can cry
When it all falls apart
But I believe the more you laugh
The more you heal the heart
[Chorus]
There's always a reason to always choose joy
There's something deeper that the world can't destroy
Smile, when you think you can't
Smile, get up and dance
Smile, there's a bigger plan
And you've got a reason
To smile, when you think you can't
Smile, just clap your hands
Smile, there's a bigger plan
You've got a reason to smile

My God is able to save
And deliver and heal
And restore anything that He wants to
Just ask the man
Who was thrown
On the bones of Elisha
If there’s anything that He can’t do
Just ask the stone
That was rolled
At the tomb in the garden
What happens when God says to move
I feel Him moving it now
I feel Him doing it now
I feel Him doing it now
Do it now, do it now

As I lie awake and wonder what the future will hold
Help me to remember that You're in control

I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, I'm laying it down

Long before my first breath
Running into Your arms

Just as I am You pull me in
And I know I need You now

My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

The devil thought he had a hold of me

Got to weak to carry on
I thought that I was too far gone
But then I heard a voice from Calvary

I hit my knees and mercy floods my soul
And though the enemy is near
I'm not giving into fear
Cause You're the voice of truth that leads me home
So I'm singing...

Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God

To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down

We watch our worship on a screen
We got a Rockstar preacher
Who won't wake us from our dreams
We want out blessings in our pocket
We keep our missions overseas
But for the hurting in our cities
Would we even cross the street?

Huh but we wanna see the heart set free and the tyrants kneel
The walls fall down and our land be healed
But church if we want to see a change in the world out there

Who turned his nose and puffed his chest
He didn't run off like his brother
But his soul was just as dead
What if the church on Sunday
Was still the church on Monday too?
What if we came down from our towers
And walked a mile in someone's shoes?

Hmm 'cause we wanna see the heart set free and the tyrants kneel
The walls fall down and our land be healed
But church if we want to see a change in the world out there

When the going gets tough
And my strength's not enough
I see You showing up like never before
This battle for my heart
You took on from the start
You are the peace when my mind's at war
And ohhh
[Chorus]
You will never stop fighting for me
When I can’t fight for myself
Every word is a promise You keep
'Cause You love me like nobody else
You stand up for me in the darkest night
When my faith is weak You're still by my side
You will never stop fighting for me
You will never stop fighting for me
[Bridge]
Your love is winning me over
Your heart is pulling me closer
Your love is winning me over
Your heart is pulling me closer
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never stop
Fighting for me, fighting for me
Every word is a promise You keep
Ohhh, yeah
[Chorus]
You will never stop fighting for me
When I can't fight for myself (When I can't)
Every word is a promise You keep
Cause You love me like nobody else (Nobody)
You stand up for me (You stand up for me)
In the darkest night (In the darkest night)
When my faith is weak (Yeah yeah)

Thank God for the daylight, I spent a long time in the dark
Felt good saying "Goodbye", waking up to a brand new heart
And if you're sleeping like I used to be, in a grave that holds you tight
There's a Savior calling, mm, promising a brand new life, He's saying
[Chorus]
Wake up, sleeper, open your eyes
Oh, sinner, arise, leave your past at the door
Wake up, sleeper, come to the light
Christ is alive, death don't live here anymore
Death don't live here anymore
[Verse 2]
I bet you like that freedom, ooh, I bet you like your new name
Oh, welcome to the kingdom, yeah, we all feel that way (Mm-mm, mm)
So if you meet somebody sleeping like the way you used to be
Tell 'em bout the Savior, ayy, and a little thing called "Free"
Go ahead and say
[Chorus]
Wake up, sleeper, open your eyes
Oh, sinner, arise, leave your past at the door
Wake up, sleeper, come to the light
Christ is alive, death don't live here anymore
[Bridge]
Rise up and come out of that grave
Rise up in that amazing grace
Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?
Come awake (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Rise up and come out of that grave
Rise up in that amazing grace
Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?
Come awake
[Chorus]
Wake up, sleeper, open your eyes
Oh, sinner, arise, leave your past at the door
Wake up, sleeper, come to the light
Christ is alive, death don't live here anymore
[Outro]
Rise up and come out of that grave
Rise up in that amazing grace
Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?
Come awake
Rise up and come out of that grave
Rise up in that amazing grace
Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?

[Chorus: John Summit]
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to—
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Uh, stay on point, I've been tryna save my voice
But y'all gave me no choice
The world gone mad, can't ignore this noise
Look at these people found dead in the streets
I got some partners that hate the police
Me, I'm just tryna hold onto my peace
'Cause I'm liable to lose it and go get the piece (Yah)
I need a reason, I need a season
Pleaded with Jesus, all of this grievin'
They be like, "F you and what you believe in"
I do not trip, I keep it G
What in the H you sayin' to I? (I)
Ain't no JK when I'm talkin' to God (God)
Don't need a reason to open my eyes
If I'm still breathin', I'm runnin' for Ahmaud, man (Runnin' for Ahmaud)
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)
Deep end of this pit, but still somehow I keep on floating on
Thought I lost my grip, but God reminded me He's holding on
[Chorus: John Summit]
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to—
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, I might go crazy
I might go MJ back in the 80s
Back in the 90s, I might go off
Well, they better not try me, it might get dicey
I ain't tryna go back to the old me (Nah)
I'm tryna hang on like my mama told me
Sometimes legs get weak and your arms give out
And you sink to the bottom slowly (Sink to the bottom slow)
A grown man wishing that somebody hold me (Hold)
Never knew my daddy, so nobody showed me
Taught me how to walk through the storm when your heart feel heavy
And it's hard and you're feeling lonely
But lowkey, high priest got the keys to the kingdom
High key low enough to bring 'em
And I need all of what He's bringing
I might go off the deep end, I just need another reason, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before (Woo)
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)
Deep end of this pit, but still somehow I keep on floating on
Thought I lost my grip, but God reminded me He's holding on
[Chorus: John Summit]
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to—

I don't want to be on my phone but I can't be alone
Welcome to the modern way
Trying to be somebody I'm not but it's not what I want
Tell me there's another way
[Pre-Chorus]
All of the lights I chased are now faded
All the cheap thrills were only time wasted
Tell me why society's plan should define who I am
Surely there's a higher way
[Chorus]
All of my best friends are sick of pretending
We want the truth (We want it, we want it)
So much is missing
So give us the real thing
I know it's You
(Na-na, na-na, na)

I'm over trying to find the next hype
'Cause the high never lasts

I've stacking up the years I spent trading punches with the enemy
Built myself a double thick stone tower of lies, higher than the eye could see
Trapped in my flesh & bone
Crying out to You Lord, I’m desperate
Love come rattle this cage and set me free
[Chorus]
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Oh Lord, my prison turns to ruin
When Your love moves in
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Come down
[Verse 2]
Truth was crashing through the pride and the blame
Cutting straight to the heart of me
Long before I ever called your name
You were fighting for my victory
Carved in Your flesh and bone
The wounds that have said my souls forgiven
Oh now I can feel the darkness trembling
[Chorus]
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Oh Lord, my prison turns to ruin
When Your love moves in
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Come down
[Bridge]
Rebuild me from the ground up
All I wanna see is You
Terrify the lies with truth
[Chorus]
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Oh Lord, my prison turns to ruin
When Your love moves in
All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down
Come down

All of my fears, like Jericho walls
Gotta come down, come down

And the night is long but the world keeps turning

Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now

At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out

It's a blessing I can't see yet
[Outro: Jason Roy &

I trust You in everything
I trust You in everything, oh God

When You speak, confusion fades
Just a word and suddenly I'm not afraid
'Cause You speak and freedom reigns
There is hope in every single word You say
[Chorus: Chris McClarney, 
Chris McClarney & Hollyn
]
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
'Cause everything You say is life to me
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
Quiet my heart, I'm listening
[Verse 2: Hollyn]
When sorrows roll and troubles rage
You whisper peace when I don't have the words to say
I won't lose hope when storms won't break
You keep Your word, oh, and Your promises will keep me safe
[Chorus: Chris McClarney & Hollyn]
Oh, I don't wanna miss one word You speak
'Cause everything You say is life to me
Oh, I don't wanna miss one word You speak
So quiet my heart, I'm listening
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Hollyn, 
Hollyn & Chris McClarney
]
Your ways are higher
You know just what I need
I trust You, Jesus
You see what I cannot see
Your ways are higher
You know just what I need
I trust You, Jesus
You see what I cannot see
[Chorus: Chris McClarney & Hollyn]
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
'Cause everything You say is life to me (No)
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
So quiet my heart, I'm listening
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
'Cause everything You say is life to me
No, I don't wanna miss one word You speak
So quiet my heart, I'm listening
[Outro: Chris McClarney, 
Chris McClarney & Hollyn
]
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
'Cause everything You say is life to me
I don't wanna miss one word You speak
So quiet my heart, I'm listening

Copy [Verse 1]
I have looked for You in the mountains
Waited for the ground to shake
I've searched the sky for something amazing
Remind me there's another way
[Pre-Chorus]
Just as marvelous
Still miraculous
[Chorus]
I see You in the ordinary
Every breath I breathe
In my own heartbeat
I know You're always right here with me
Nothing is mundane
Your glory is displayed
In a million ways
In the ordinary
You make my days
Extraordinary
In the ordinary
[Verse 2]
In the sunrise that wakes the morning
Or watching as the seasons' change
In a heart to heart conversation
And joy that can't be contained
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's marvelous
So miraculous
[Chorus]
I see You in the ordinary
Every breath I breathe
In my own heartbeat
I know You're always right here with me
Nothing is mundane
Your glory is displayed
In a million ways
In the ordinary
You make my days
Extraordinary
[Bridge]
I want to see You
I want to know You
I want to find You
In every moment
Your presence
Is present
I believe it
In every moment
[Chorus]
I see You in the ordinary, ohh
I see You in the ordinary
Every breath I breathe
In my own heartbeat
I know You're always right here with me
Nothing is mundane
Your glory is displayed
In a million ways
In the ordinary
You make my days
Extraordinary, ohh
[Outro]
You are extraordinary
In the ordinary
