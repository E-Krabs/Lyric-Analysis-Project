[Verse 1]
You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ
[Chorus 1]
What a beautiful Name it is
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Verse 2]
You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus You brought heaven down
My sin was great Your love was greater
What could separate us now?
[Chorus 2]
What a wonderful Name it is
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a wonderful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Interlude]
[Bridge 1]
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again...
[Bridge 2]
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
[Chorus 3]
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Bridge 2]
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
[Chorus 3]
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus...
[Outro]
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus!

Copy [Verse 1]
They say sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't
[Pre-Chorus]
It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Verse 2]
They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well, good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Bridge]
You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
‘Cause I know You're able
I know You can
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Outro]
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

Copy [Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clingin' to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waitin' for 'em to attack
They say "Don't get bitter, get better."
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm goin' through
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They say fear haunts and pain hates
I say pain strengthens and fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
And hopin' that I'll put together somethin' right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
No don't let the fear make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I – I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies
If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside
There's a better life, there's a better life
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker
[Verse 2]
We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night
We've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fight
We've all run to things we know just ain't right
When there's a better life, there's a better life
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker
[Bridge]
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify, testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

Oh, my soul
Oh, how you worry
Oh, how you're weary from fearing
You lost control
This was the one thing
You didn't see coming
And no one would blame you though
If you cried in private
If you tried to hide it away
So no one knows
No one will see
If you stop believing
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone
[Verse 2]
Here and now
You can be honest
I won't try to promise
That someday it all works out
'Cause this is the valley
And even now
He is breathing on your dry bones
And there will be dancing
There will be beauty where beauty was
Ash and stone
This much I know
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
[Bridge]
I'm not strong enough
I can't take anymore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
And my shipwrecked faith
Will never get me to shore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
Can he find me here?
Can he keep me, from going under?
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone

Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?

I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days

And I've prayed prayers to heaven
From my lowest place
And I have held Your blessings
God, You give and take away

No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown, where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep,
 
my faith will stand
[Chorus]
And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
[Verse 2]
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now
[Chorus]
So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine, oh
(And You are mine, oh)

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Keep my eyes above the waves

I was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze
Singin' like a song through the tall oak trees
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
[Verse 2]
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered to You, You
Uh, You were there, You heard my prayer
In that broke-down, dusty room
It was the first time I said, "I'm Yours"
The first time I called You "Lord"
[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
[Bridge]
Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song through the oak trees
Pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built, opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that was headed to my heart
But You hit the mark
[Chorus]
When love broke through 
(Love)
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert 
(Desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken 
(Thank you, Jesus)
And it all began with You 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert 
(Desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken 
(Chains are broken)
And it all began with You
When love broke through
(It all began with You, it all began with You)
And it all began with You
When love broke through
(It all began with You, Jesus)
[Outro]
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me

This world is not what it was meant to be
All this pain, all this suffering
There’s a better place waiting for me
In heaven
[Verse 2]
Every tear will be wiped away
Every sorrow and sin erased
We’ll dance on seas of amazing grace
In heaven, in heaven
I'm going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
Home
[Verse 3]
Lay down my burdens, I lay down my past
I run to Jesus, no turning back
Thank God Almighty, I’ll be free at last
In heaven, in heaven
I'm going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
[Bridge]
Blinded eyes
Will finally see
The dead will rise
On the shores of eternity
The trump will sound
The angels will sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I am going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
Where I belong

If grace was a kingdom, I stopped at the gate
Thinking I don’t deserve to pass through after all the mistakes that I’ve made
Oh, but I heard a whisper as Heaven bent down
Said, “Child, don’t you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown”
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
[Verse 2]
The pages of history they tell me it’s true
That it’s never the perfect; it’s always the ones with the scars that You use
Oh, it’s the rebels and the prodigals; it’s the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose, tell me there’s hope for sinners like me
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
I'm all Yours
[Outro]
Grace is a kingdom with gates open wide
There’s a seat at the table just waiting for you
So, come on inside

As I walk this great unknown
Questions come and questions go
Was there purpose for the pain?
Did I cry these tears in vain?
[Verse 2]
I don't want to live in fear
I want to trust that You are near
Trust Your grace can be seen
In both triumph and tragedy
[Chorus]
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
[Verse 3]
But sometimes my faith feels thin
Like the night will never end
Will You catch every tear
Or will You just leave me here?
[Chorus]
But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
[Bridge]
So, whatever happens I will not be afraid
Cause You are closer than this breath that I take
You calm the storm when I hear You call my name
I still believe that one day I'll see Your face
[Chorus]
And I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

You're with me and You won't let go

Not scared to say it
I used to be the one
Preaching it to you
That you could overcome
I still believe it
But it ain't easy
'Cause that world I painted
Where things just all work out
It started changing
And I started having doubts
And it got me so down
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I picked myself back up
And I started telling me
No, my God's not done
Making me a masterpiece
He's still working on me

He started something good and I'm gonna believe it
He started something good and He's gonna complete it
So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through
I'm just unfinished

So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through

And the kind of God He is
He might make it a mystery
But He's proving I can trust in Him
And yeah, I believe it

Trading punches with the heart of darkness
Going to blows with your fear incarnate
Never gone until it's stripped away
A part of you has gotta die to change
[Verse 2]
In the morning you gon' need an answer
Ain't nobody gonna change the standard
It's not enough to just feel the flame
You've gotta burn your old self away

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It take some time to make your courage strong

A restless generation
We're turning over every stone
Hoping to find salvation
In a world that's left us cold
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
[Verse 2]
It's the cure for our condition
It's the good news for us all
It's greater than religion
It's the power of the Cross
[Pre-Chorus]
So can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night

The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way
[Spoken Word]
The amazing news of the Gospel
Is not that we can receive Jesus into our lives
But that He's already received us
Into​ His
[Bridge]
In my own life, it means forgiveness
When I know I deserved the fall
It called me out of my darkness
And carried me to the Cross
In a moment, my eyes were opened
In that moment, my heart was changed
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
Ohh!..
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way

Head full of questions, how can you measure up?
To deserve affection, to ever be enough
For this existence, when did it get so hard?
Your heart is beating, alive and breathing
And there's a reason why
You are essential, not accidental
And you should realize

It pulls you under, and you just fall away

But there's a purpose under the surface
And you don't have to drown
Let me remind you, that love will find you
Let it lift you out

After the heartache of wrong turns and sidetracks
Just when they think they've got you game set match

Just when they think there's nothing left running on empty

Word of life
Speak to my weary heart
Strengthen my broken parts
Lead me to Your open arms
Word of truth
Illuminate all these lies
The enemy speaks inside
In freedom I will rise
[Chorus]
'Cause You called me out from the grave
So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in
Your word of life
(Your word of life)

Spirit of God
Take me to a deeper place
Take me out of what is safe
I will not be afraid
Spirit of God
Fill me with joy again
Springing up from within
It cannot be contained

'Cause You called me out from the grave
So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in

Only Your love remains
I am alive today
'Cause You called me out, ooh
You called me out, ooh

Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living colour
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

In the air of second life
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind

Turning wilderness to wonder

Through the eyes of men it seems there's so much we have lost
As we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked
One by one the enemy has whispered lies and led them off as slaves
[Verse 2]
But we know that You are God, Yours is the victory
We know there is more to come that we may not yet see
So with the faith You've given us, 
we step into the valley unafraid, yeah
[Chorus]
As we call out to dry bones, "Come alive, come alive"
We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"
[Verse 3]
God of endless mercy, God of unrelenting love
Rescue every daughter, bring us back the wayward sons
And by Your spirit breathe upon them
Show the world that You alone can save
You alone can save
[Chorus]
As we call out to dry bones, "Come alive, come alive"
We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"

So breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe, oh breath of God
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe, oh breath of God
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe

We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"

We call out to dry bones, "Come alive… oh come alive"

I've been trying to make sense of the sorrow that I feel
Holding on for life to the only thing that's real
I've only scratched the surface, I've barely had a taste
But just a glimpse draws my heart to change
And one sight of You lays my sin to waste
I don't need to see everything just more of You
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
[Verse 2]
My sight is incomplete and I've made You look small
I've been staring at my problems for way too long
Re-align where my hope is set, until You're all that's left
But just a glimpse draws my heart to change
And one sight of You lays my sin to waste
I don't need to see everything just more of You
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You

Oh God be greater, than the worries in my life
Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind
Be louder, let your Glory come alive
Be magnified
Oh God be greater, than the worries in my life
Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind
Be louder, let your Glory come alive
Be magnified
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You, to You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes

Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away

Of the innocent dying

Are you not afraid?

You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying

Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world back to God

I tried to fit you in the walls inside my mind
I try to keep you safely inbetween the lines
I try to put you in the box that I've designed
I try to pull you down so we are eye to eye
[Chorus]
When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world?
I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world
How could I make you so small
When you're the one who holds it all
When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world

Just a whisper of your voice can tame the seas
So who am I to try to take the lead
Still I run ahead and think I'm strong enough
When you're the one who made me from the dust

Copy We're all related
Brothers and strangers
The king and the beggar bleed the same
We've all got a sickness
A terminal condition
We medicate it
But the pain won't go away
See the eyes of a million faces
Lookin' for it in a million places
Only one can save us, Jesus
You are the cure
Everybody's searching for it
Everybody's reaching out
Trying to grab a hold of something real
You are the cure
Only you can satisfy us
Fill up the void inside us
Never been a heart you couldn't heal
You are the cure
You are the doctor
Healer and father
To the orphan without a home
We fell into darkness
We were lost till you found us
You're the remedy we're looking for
You are the cure for the broken
The hope for a hopeless world
The meaning the purpose
The peace that will make us whole
You don't have to search no more

I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up
[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you
[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there
[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say

Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down

Cause that's what I do, thats what I do

To let go of what you're holding to
It's too late, too far
You're too small, it's too hard
Throwing water on that spark
Living deep inside your heart
With oceans of reasons
The things you're not seeing
But oh, maybe they don't
Know what you know
That you're not alone

Don't you be afraid

So step into the fight
He's right there by your side
The stones inside your hand might be small
But watch the giants fall

Can't you imagine it
So bold, so brave
With childlike faith
Miracles could happen
Mountains would start moving
So whatever you may face

Don't you be afraid
Of giants in your way

So step into the fight
He's right there by your side

We trust the name of Jesus!

You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

In love and justice You remain
Every knee will bow
We bring our expectations
Our hope is anchored in Your name
The name of Jesus!
We trust the name of Jesus!!

You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus
From age to age You reign
Your kingdom has no end
We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus
From age to age You reign
Your kingdom has no end!
[Chorus 2]
You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, forevermore!..
You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious!!!
Victorious!!

Mirror mirror, mirror on the wall
Tellin' those lies, pointing out your flaws
That isn’t who you are
That isn’t who you are
[Verse 2: Joel]
It might be hard to hear, but let me tell you, dear
If you could see what I can see, I know you would believe
That isn’t who you are
There’s more to who you are
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
So when it’s late, you’re wide awake
Too much to take
Don’t you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave, hear me say
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)
[Verse 3: Joel]
No matter what you’ve heard, this is what you're worth
More than all the money or the diamonds and pearls
Oh, this is who you are
Yeah, this is who you are
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
So when it’s late, you’re wide awake
Too much to take
Don’t you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave, hear me say
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)

Sisters, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Love, we can start again
Brothers, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Yeah, we can start again
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
(You're) Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)
[Outro]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (we can start again)
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
Oh so priceless

God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I
[Verse 2]
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I
So will I
[Bridge]
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
[Verse 3]
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die
[Chorus 3]
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart eight billion different ways
Every precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I
[Tag]
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

There is a wrestling in my heart and my mind
A disturbance and a tension I cannot seem to drive
And if I'm honest, there's quite a bit of fear
To sit here in this silence and really hear You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What will You ask of me?
Will I listen to Your voice when You speak?
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes things, they are black and white
Sometimes they are not and that leaves us torn inside
And in the middle, we are left to wonder
Who we are, what You want and where we're going
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh such a mystery
I don't always understand
But I believe!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Bridge]
I don't know the future, it's one day at a time
But I know I'll be okay with Your hand holding mine
So take all my resistance
Oh God I need Your grace
One step and then the other
Show me the way
Show me the way!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
God help me

I believe that You are God alone
But sometimes I still try to take control
'Cause I get scared when I can't see the end
And all You want from me is to let go

You're parting waters, making a way for me
You're moving mountains that I don't even see
You've answered my prayer, before I even speak
All You need for me to be is still

I bring my praise before I bring my need
'Cause there's no fear You've not already seen
I rest my heart on all Your promises
'Cause I have seen and know Your faithfulness

Copy DOUG HANNAH: Well hey, I'm Doug Hannah, and I think you're gonna recognize these guys: Peter Furler, Michael Tait, Newsboys United. Guys, welcome.
MICHAEL TAIT: Thank you.
PETER FURLER: Thanks, Doug.
HANNAH: Well, congratulations on the record.
TAIT: Thank you, Doug.
HANNAH: Excellent stuff, and, uh, I, I really would like to know... Uh, Peter, I'll start with you, since you kinda came back: What led you to wanna rejoin, or reform, with Newsboys United?
FURLER: Well, you know, the boys started working on a song called "The Cross Has The Final Word," and uh, they just kinda called up and said, "Would you like to, you know, be a part of it? Maybe just produce the track and, and see what you do to it?" And so I went into the studio, and uh, I sung down a guide vocal, and they really dug it and they're like "Hey, can we keep you on this track?" You know, and I was like "Yeah," so next minute we're doing kind of a, a guest vocal thing, featuring, you know, myself.
FURLER: You know, when you're working together, you start to have conversations more and, and uh, we started chatting about what would it look like to have the two eras of the band tour at the same time, and uh, I think—you know, Michael and I, we've discussed this, we—before it started, we didn't know if it was gonna work, or how it was gonna work. In fact, I think we only booked a certain amount of dates.
TAIT: Just in case.
HANNAH: Just to try it out, yeah.
FURLER: Yeah, if it didn't work, we could all escape, and uh... [Hannah and Tait laughing] But uh, but it worked really well, you know, it was great. And we've loved it, and then, you know, moving forward, it's morphed into something completely different. It's really, we've uh, we've obviously done shows together now, we've done about 120 shows, and we're kind of, uh, keeping each other on more on stage, like "Mike, can you sing on this?"
HANNAH: Yep, and the next step now is you're all gonna get an apartment building and just live communally.
FURLER: Well we will, we'll be living back where we started out, that's what we—no, we're actually gonna get a van down by the riverside. [All three laughing]
HANNAH: Was this all your bright idea, Mike?
TAIT: No, of course not, bro, no.
FURLER: Just say yes! [Hannah and Furler laughing]
HANNAH: "Of course not!"
TAIT: But what's cool about [?] is, it's, it's like a superband now, you know?
HANNAH: It is.
TAIT: And Peter and I go back way back, back in the days with K Max, are our besties and Tobymac, back one day, we did the Nu Skool Jam.
FURLER: That's right.
TAIT: Touring together, we had no clue we'd be together, and it's been an absolute pleasure and joy. I love this man, and I've had a great time on stage.
HANNAH: But everybody's great friends, brothers, and, and it's just, families are tight.
TAIT: Amen.
HANNAH: But what were, you must have had some... mixed emotions a little bit? I mean, you left for a reason. Nine years fast-forward, you're back in, did you have to wrestle with any of that, or was it just like "Nope, I'm in, let's do it"?
FURLER: Coming back, I didn't really have to wrestle because we had, it was a slow process of kind of—
TAIT: Very subtle.
FURLER: Yeah, just kind of working on the song together and kinda hanging like we're hanging now.
TAIT: And the best part about it, to be honest—and the best part, and kinda the weirdest part is that—let's face it, Peter started this thing years ago when I started DC Talk with Tobymac. I'm more concerned about how it's gonna work, as opposed to how I feel.
HANNAH: What is so—just as an outsider—what is so impressive to me about it, looking at it from a distance a little bit, is, th-this, this unity that you have, I think you can feel it in the concert for sure,
TAIT: No question.
HANNAH: I think you can feel it in the records, I think it sends a really good message. And I feel, when I look at it—
TAIT: And you can't fake it from stage, people—
HANNAH: Of course not.
TAIT: People can feel the difference. They feel—when you're on stage, you're getting along with each other, you're lovin' each other—you can't fake the funk, baby. They know what's up. They get it.
FURLER: That's right.
HANNAH: You—l-let's stop and—"You can't fake the funk, baby"?
FURLER: My favorite saying. [Tait cracking up]
HANNAH: That's an important—
FURLER: That's trademarked, by the way.
TAIT: Trademarked, that's right.
HANNAH: Get the lawyers on that right now.
FURLER: TM.
HANNAH: So people just checked out the Newsboys United record, now they're like, "I wanna see Newsboys United on tour." We know it's gonna be a lot of fun, we know it's gonna be high-energy. What is something that might surprise people if they come check you out on tour?
FURLER: Uh, there's, there is one thing I really appreciate with all of the guys, is there is a gratefulness. We don't...
TAIT: Yes!
FURLER: We kinda know who we are, and we don't have...
TAIT: Thank you Jesus.
FURLER: We, we, you know, we, we can have a meal in Nashville at a restaurant and there are probably ten musicians in that restaurant serving the food that are way better than we are, or, you know...
TAIT: That's a fact!
FURLER: So there's a gratefulness of, man, there's so many people, talented people, that are on tour we see, we see people that are rising up and some that are doing different things, but we are grateful.
TAIT: And one thing I've always loved about Newsboys, before I joined and even now in being in the band, is back in the day, Toby and I would look at Newsboys' production. Their shows were always over the top. I'm like, "How can these guys afford this?" And now, I'm in the band, and sometimes we still can't afford it but we do it anyway. [Hannah and Furler laughing] And, our shows are second to none as far as production too.
HANNAH: That's the truth.
TAIT: So I'm gonna have the production side down, Pete, and the musical side down, God on board, what more can you say?
HANNAH: Yep, there you go. I-I know hope, I know the gospel, I know, I know w—those are the themes of the record. But if, is the—is there a preeminent message or theme that people are gonna get when they, when they listen through track-by-track to Newsboys United?
FURLER: Yeah, I think they're gonna be encouraged, you know. And um, and they're gonna feel unity. Right now we're living in a country, and a world, that is very divided, and maybe getting more so. Um, uh, so I think they'll sense a unity, and they'll feel encouraged. I think uh, I think the one thing about Newsboys music that has always been its constant, you know, it's tried different things and different instruments and different arrangements and things but there's always a, a joy to it.
HANNAH: One final personal question for each of you: what is the preeminent thing that God is teaching/showing/revealing to you in this season of your life right now? Personally, now.
FURLER: I think for me, um... Not to weigh yourself out to get rich, have the wisdom to show restraint. The borrower is slave to the lender, you know. I think for me, um, you know, growing up in coming from a middle class, lower-middle class family, and then coming into a lot of success, I got caught up in material things. And so the last decade, last—it's just been living a simple life. And it's more the practical things that are in the Bible. A lot of times we get hyped up on, uh, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Well, you can't if you're in debt up to your eyeballs, know what I mean? [Hannah laughing] So, it's just some practical things. There's a lot of practical things in the Proverbs, and uh, that really speak to me at this time.
HANNAH: Tait, man, what about you?
TAIT: Wow, Pete, how can I follow that?
HANNAH: Yeah, go ahead and try though.
TAIT: Bishop Furler over there. [Hannah laughing] Um, a lot of people are, are kind of shocked by this when I say it, and thinking, "well you're Michael Tait, you know, you're DC Talk, you're this guy, you're that Christian, blah blah blah." But it turns out that every day I'm human, and my humanness makes me doubt my faith sometimes, makes me doubt that God actually loves me. So in this season, I spend a lot of time in the Word. I spend, I mean, there's, probably not a day goes by where I don't actually read the Word and get into it. The Word I know so well, but I read, study the concordance and, and all the commentary on it. I read about a God that loves me so deeply—and it's hard to grasp sometimes, 'cause I've [?] lovin' myself sometimes. But I know God loves me that much, I can then walk out the house, accept the fact that I don't have this or that or I might lack here or there, but it's not about that. It's about knowing the Savior, vertical. "Love God," first commandment, "and love your neighbor as yourself."
HANNAH: Well said. The cross demonstrates what you're talking about too, so amen to that. Well it's been a privilege for me, over a few decades now, to, to watch you all in your various endeavors and to play you on the radio and cheer you on and talk to you.
FURLER: Thank you, Doug.
TAIT: You-you're my favorite, Doug, also, you're my favorite guy. Doug Hannah.
HANNAH: Well thank you, thank you very much. I really appreciate that. I, I, I'm thankful too for everybody who has listened to this. If, if you haven't listened to the record yet, go back, hit track 1. Come see Newsboys United in concert, uh, i-it, you will—especially if you don't know, like, you'll walk out of there and you're gonna be like, "Wow, I cannot believe what I just saw." You, uh—s-suffice it to say, you get a lot for your money when you go see the Newsboys. And God just might use the music to change your life, so. Check out newsboys.com for the tour stop closest to you. Thanks for listening. Thanks Michael, thanks Peter.
FURLER: Thanks Doug.
TAIT: Thanks Doug.
HANNAH: I'm Doug Hannah, Newsboys United.

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen

Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

What if you could go back
And relive one day of your life all over again
And unmake the mistake
That left you a million miles away
From the you, you once knew
Now yesterday's shame
Keeps saying that you'll never get back on track
But what if I told you

You're one step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone
You're one step away

It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Mercy says
You don't have to keep running down the road you're on
Love's never met a lost cause
Your shame, lay it down
Leave your ghosts in the past
'Cause you know that you can't go back
But you can turn around
You've never been more than

One step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open

Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

So come on home, come on home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're just one step away

Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't it just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything
[Chorus 1]
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts too much to see
Keep your eyes on me
[Verse 2]
Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun
[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me
[Bridge]
You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

California drivin’ had to get out
Distance got me wonderin’ where You are right now
One-way conversations
 got me worn down
Pouring out my heart wish You would speak a sound
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost
[Chorus]
Without Your love
There’s no point in even wakin’ up
No, no, no, no
Without Your love
Nothin’s ever gonna be enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t get you outta my head
And I don’t wanna ever forget
You give me what the world could never give
I can’t live without Your love
[Verse 2]
Starin’ at the ceiling after midnight
Over-thinkin’ everything in my whole life
All of these regrets are clouding my mind
Lord I need the strength to try it one more time
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cuz now I know what I’m after
Now I know what I’m doin’
Now I know what I’m after

What I want is You
I can’t live without Your love

I was buried beneath my shame
Who could carry that kind of weight
It was my tomb
Till I met You
[Verse 2]
I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb
Till I met You

You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness

Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all I know
The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave

I needed rescue
My sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
I needed shelter
I was an orphan
Now You call me a citizen of heaven
When I was broken
You were my healing
Your love is the air that I'm breathing
I have a future
My eyes are open
[Chorus]
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness

How many times can one heart break?
It was never supposed to be this way
Look in the mirror, but you find someone you never thought you'd be
Oh, but I can still recognize
The one I love in your tear stained eyes
I know you might not see him now, so lift your eyes to me
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Verse 2]
You see your worst mistake
But I see the price I paid
There's nothing you could ever do, to lose what grace has won
So hold on, it's not the end
No, this is where love's work begins
I'm making all things new
And I will make a miracle of you
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Bridge]
I see my child, my beloved
The new creation you're becoming
You see the scars from when you fell
But I see the stories they will tell
You see worthless, I see priceless
You see pain, but I see a purpose
You see unworthy, undeserving
But I see you through eyes of mercy
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
You're not too far gone
You're one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet, no
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Outro]
Ooh, I see mended
Woah, oh I see mended
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended

In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
[Verse 1]
When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet
Between the black skies, and my red eyes, I can barely see
When I realize I've been sold out by my friends and my family
I can feel the rain reminding me
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
[Verse 2: GabeReal]
Mmm, when my hopes and dreams are far from me
And I'm runnin' out of faith
I see the future I picture slowly fade away
And when the tears of pain and heartache
Are pouring down my face
I find my peace in Jesus' name
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm (yeah, yeah)
You remain in control (yes you do, Lord)
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me (Your love surrounds me)
In the eye of the storm (in the eye of the storm)
[Verse 3]
When the test comes in and the doctor says
I've only got a few months left
It's like a bitter pill I'm swallowing
I can barely take a breath
And when addiction steals my baby girl
And there's nothing I can do
My only hope is to trust You
I trust You, Lord
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm
You remain in control
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
You remain in control
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
Oh, in the eye of
Lord, in the eye of the storm
I know You're watching me, yeah
Ay

When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone, Lord)
When my flesh is failing
You're still holding on, oh whoa
When the storm is raging (the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and all my hope is gone)
When my flesh is failing (my flesh is failing)
You're still holding on, ooh
When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone)
Even when my flesh is failing (flesh is failing)
You're still holding on, holding on

The Lord is my Shepherd
I have all that I need
He let's me rest in green meadows
He leads me beside peaceful streams
He renews my strength
He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to His Name
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid
For You are close beside me

My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house
Hey!
[Chorus]
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Woo!)
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Oh yeah!)
All I spit is real life (Real life) (Yeah!)

Yeah
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average."
He asked me, "What does that mean?"
I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please."
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time
Oh yeah!

Wonder if I'll ever amount to much
Seems like no matter what I do
It's never gonna be good enough
Should I just give up?
Lord, I need to hear You speak
Tell me I am loved
Tell me I am known
That You died for me
I am not alone
Tell me I'm Your child
The one Your heart beats for
I can find my strength
Knowing I am Yours
You've always known what my heart needs
And You tell me
You wrote Your name upon my heart
You knew me before my life began
You still have a plan
And when I'm starting to forget
Jesus, You tell me who I am
Who I am
You tell me I am loved
Tell me I am known
And that You died for me
I am not alone
You tell me I'm Your child

I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to feel at home
I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone (Yeah)
I got an issue with people pretending they like what they don't
Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah, it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though
I don't care if I am on the billboards
On a killing spree, I'm about to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord
 (Haha)
We just getting warmed up
Yeah, I said I was coming, I warned ya
So close to the fans, 
I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime? 
They come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now, but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins (Yeah)
We ain't talked in like six years, why you writing me now?
I just turned a 100k down, just to keep the brand looking right, now (That's real)
I ain't bragging about the money, I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account
Or the bank amounts, I'm a business man
But don't touch my money, I don't play around, woo!
Lights out when the mic's out
About to hit the West Coast, hype crowds
I just put a record out, what you think I'm gonna pipe down?
Nah, I've been looking for a beat, look what I found, woo!
I mean everything is coming out of my mouth
Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh yeah? Well, tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done though
What's coming next year? 
Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow, anybody wanna be the one
To make an issue out of nothing? I'ma hit you with my iPhone
I know, I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't looking for a handout
You ain't like what I was doing last year which is funny
'Cause you lookin' like a fan now, are you a fan now?
I kinda miss being broke, 
now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school and hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper, they smiled and looked at me, "Okay
That's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job." Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that will bring up your name for nothing
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude, but I could get you on my worst days
Say nothing for me, do it all the time
Yeah they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, "Who am I?"
Now this year they like, "You the guy"
Here's a little some' for your car rides
If they said I fell off, they all lied
Yeah, you know the logo, better recognize
Yeah, it's Real Music 'til the day we die,

Like castles of sand, castles of sand
My fear, like an enemy army
Is marching again, but I'm making a stand

I’m scared I’ve started to forget
Your body and your ticking head
But I’ll clutch straws as I’m holding
Remaining memories close to me
And looks that warrant blasphemy
And times that most poor souls won’t see
[Chorus]
But in the night I develop your legs
Onto the negatives in my head
But I’ll keep them crossed let’s not pretend all hope is not lost
And that we aren’t the living dead
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass to my head
[Verse 2]
What was it that Jesus said? Was it bread or wine first I forget
'Cause I left god in the cradle
I wish I hadn’t gone and drank my rеnt 'cause it did nothing for my head
I’d love to look up and feel stablе
[Chorus]
But in the night you burn in my head
Like a stubbed out cigarette
Your ever-pirouetting silhouette against my doorstep
Follows, follows me to bed
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass to my head
[Vocalizing]
[Bridge]
What’s a man supposed to be when his lust turns to frozen peas
With no hot drop left in his head
I’ll come to lie with your new life and redefine my finish line
And leave your love sit on your fence
[Chorus]
But in the night I develop your legs
Onto the negatives in my head
But I’ll keep them crossed let’s not pretend all hope is not lost
And that we aren’t the living dead
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass

Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come and you call to me by name
But still you come and you call to me by name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love and you don't forget my name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

Get it together
That's what I say to me
I put on the pressure
You could do better
Be who you're supposed to be
But that's when you came in
Right when I needed you
Said all of the things that I was believing
Not one of them were true
[Pre-Chorus]
You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now
[Chorus]
'Cause you stood right there
And then you broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through your eyes (saw me)
I saw me through your eyes (saw me)
I saw me through your eyes

I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

And carry it into the light

I lived my life to the limit
Where I met the end of myself
I see the edge but I know below me

I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into You

As I lost control of my life

You know how I do it, I ain't playin' with you, I've been grindin' Anybody tryna sleep on me better do somethin' with your eyelids
I hear a lot of whinin', but I don’t hear a lot of rhymin', woo!
Everybody got opinions, let it go into my ear and then I block that
Put me on stage, I'ma rock that
Sayin' you the best? Stop that
Phony, I am not that, yeah
What are y'all doin' out here? What are y'all doin' out here?
Maybe you should spend a little less time with the women in your arms and a little bit more with your career
I ain't saying I'm the best, but I should be in the top ten; give me a list of names, I'ma top them
I'm just playing with ya, I don't care where the top is
Leave me at the bottom, let me work for it
You ain't never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
Tell me that he works more, nah!
You might see me with my hoodie up, I ain't leaving 'til I finish
This industry ain't nothing but a box, but I ain't gon' climb in it
You put me inside a room full of rappers, come back in five minutes
I'ma be the only one still alive, with a note on my chest saying that I did it!
You do it for fame, we are way different
Y'all are looking weak, we ain't cooking in the same kitchen
Everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
Some of us'll never wear it out though, lemme get it!
I guess I don't understand
This wasn't part of my plan
Some of these people, they're thinking 'cause they heard the name that they really know who I am
Bring the beat down!
I got no time for these Hollywood people, I'd rather give time to my fans
You'd rather chill with these women that like you for money
But I'd rather chill with my fam, yeah
I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here grindin'
Yeah, I see the mic but you looking like a pilot
What's the point of a plane if you don't know how to fly it?

Rise of the underdog, I don't like none of y'all
I'm not like one of y'all
I'm from the jungle, I run with the son of God
Yeah, what is you running for?
They should be running from me
Most of my family, we don't even speak
I'm getting married in 22 weeks
And they still haven't said "Hi" or wanted to meet, huh?
I'm not the type to complain
If we don't get it, we try it again
And I'd die for the gang, Misfit my blood
They don't like us and we question they mom like
"Why did—why did you allow your kid to like bad music?"
Woo! Promise I do it (woo!)
I'm tryna give you my everything
I don't care what they are doing
I'm tryna do what they couldn't do
Laugh at the rappers you look up to
Don't waste time with the centerfolds (ay!)
I'm alive, it's a miracle (ooh)
Freestylin' since middle school (woo!)
I will battle the principal (woo!)
Wear all black like a funeral

Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, never fell in love with the coco, never had to hold up the store with a .44
Never had the door kicked in by the feds while I'm laying in the bed on the bread that I'm gon' blow (woop!), uh
But I do know what it feel like to go to school with the knock off shoes
Eating free lunch trying to act all cool
Boy, you better know that we paid our dues
Never would I trade that (no!), 'cause it made me better
Could've made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure
But it made me richer
Yeah, being broke made me rich
And being low made you quit
But being low made me high
Take time if you want this, let's go!
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by

Being broke made me rich, yeah

Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Money may have made me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use your muscle, learn to grind, and keep your mind up on the future, man
We came out them trenches
Government assistance in the beginning
Keep them cans for the pennies
We saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wondering what I got, and wondering how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty-handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay the lawyer fee, but it's all good, the squad pitching in
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

Girl: Who's the song about, Gazelle?
Aha: Oh my goodness, why you worried...
Girl: Watchu' mean why I'm worried about it?
Aha: Look, The song - The song's about you, it's about you...
Girl: No, why am I worried about it?
Aha: The song about's you!
Girl: It's not about me! If you would just tell me the truth, all of this could be aborted...
Aha: Why does it matter?
Girl: Watchu' mean why does it matter? You know what, I'm sick of all these love songs, I watch you better when you rap...
[Verse 1]
This ain't for my fans, this for all my air conditioners
Campaign so strong, I could run for senator
Lion looking riding for something that he can't provide
Tryna kill me cause I got these powers
, I just seen a Sentinel
You'll never find identical, quit trying to compare me
Ain't doing drugs but man Aha got 'em like "how dare he?"
I understand that y'all pretending's just a means to an end
But I'm a comic geek so grown men in masks don't scare me
Lately, all these labels got me laughing, and nothing's funny
I'm tryin to hide my temper tantrum
Like you don't even have a hostage
How you ask for ransom
Call Silentó if you tryna to learn some new dances
And in addition, gettin' money so it shouldn't matter
Do whatever you have to do to make your pockets fatter
Mr. Krabs will have you slaving making Krabby Patties
I guess that we become stars and get as dumb as Patrick
My friend told me that I'm changing acting out of character
I said "Funny choice of words" cause I'm no longer acting
I walk around like I got rings around me like Saturn
Forcefield to keep away all you shenanigans
All my new stuff, I really rep Louisiana
And people who ain't from the South make and start laughing
And think that it's an insult when they call us ratchet
Hold on...hold on...hold on...
[Refrain]
They telling me that you can't have it all, you have to share the wealth
We gon' play keep away if you try to keep it for yourself
When the little man cuts out the middle, man, they put an X on Malcolm's hands so they can go and put an album on the shelf
The only problem is that if I leave then there is no one else
They tried to clone me like "Really, boy, you thought we couldn't tell?"
I lift my eyes up to the hills and then I ask God for help
And then I ask Him for forgiveness when they ask "how much for sale?"
"I need all of it, the home budget, the big numbers..."
The way we ball make 'em pause when they stop and
See them big commas, we walk around like emperors
If we ain't the GOATS then we some talking llamas with a new groove
All the money and all the clothes, the whole buffet and extra butter on the dinner roll still wouldn't be enough
[Verse 2]
Believe in God, you don't have to believe in us
They colour blind, so they ain't seeing us
And if they say they can, they lying
When they find out you can read, I guarantee they ain't buying
Wasn't gonna say a word, but I can't keep quiet
Just wanna make their pockets fatter like [?]
I'm optimistic but it doesn't mean I can't keep trying
I'm talking to myself like "Don't worry, it will be fine"
Should have a pro-bait the way these people all on my line
But I suggest you don't cross me that wouldn't be wise
Should go and pro skate the way I'm always on my grind
My bad, I apologise for that predictable line
I manoeuvre like a dope dealer, they want my supply
If you don't hear that "It's Aha" then the beat ain't mine ("IT'S AHA!")
Everyone up in my squad look like we commit crimes
You can charge me for arson 'cause I do spit fire
Born in '93 and ever since I've been that guy
Trying to buy a piece of land so I can be that squat
It bothers people when you do things without asking
All because it shows the fact you really don't need them
I'd rather be a gospel singer than a Christian rapper
'Cause Kirk Franklin got up on a Kanye feature
To tell the truth goin 'this hard ain't easy
To tell the truth the competition will prolly never beat me
Like how you beat the dude who's making all your beats and it gets worse because you can't beef because you hungry and you never bite the hand that feeds you
Y'all don't hear me, y'all just wanna look for any reason
I count my money in the back like I'm an old deacon
Turns out they feel played because all the songs the most plays
All got the AJ feature, oh Jesus
They like, "Aha, we want an interview..."
But that is on a list of things I ain't finna do
I rather be an Indian, Squanto, build me a casino
But we all know exactly what the pilgrims do
Like what you really wanna know about me that you can't just Google
They all ask the same question like "when you start doing music?"
Man, I'm TJ Henderson, smart guy with a smart mouth
The only time that I don't is when I just play stupid
They like, "I know you new to CHH but you may be the best"
And my only reply was "What was that?" I meant no disrespect
You can ask Ki'shon and Street, I never heard of it
I've only been making music, nothing more and nothing less
Basically I know who Lecrae was, and I respected his grind
He was the first rapper I recognized that was crossing the line
Up on BET showing that he wasn't ashamed of his faith
I felt I had no excuse to go and be ashamed of mine
I found out about Andy 'cause white people support they own skin
Rapping like a black guy, how could you not support him?
My homie CJ put me up on Social Club
And they were way too relatable
I always felt like a misfit
But other than that, there's Dre and 2 Chainz and J. Cole and K. Dot and Kanye and Kanye and KANYE
Big Sean, T. Scott, Future and Luther Vandross
He's the reason I've been singing, blame him for my bad notes
PJ Morton is one reason I start playing piano
Spent weekends hearing Weeknd hitting all them falsettos
Let the horns drop, I was raised in "Get Get Get It"
Listening to [?] low said he can rock it acapello
I was on to this one girl, she used to always ignore me
Now I'm the one ignoring her because I know she ain't for me
I remember we bumped T-Pain, I told her he's a legend, how he created a whole new sound but that's a whole 'nother story
But anyways why these strangers hit me up I just wonder
Plus the females, how they even go get my number?
They called my phone like "What's good, do you have time to talk?"
With no more excuses, I'mma start saying "No, I don't wanna"
They like I just hit you up because I'm trying to connect
Like I got WiFi for them to go get on internet
I say "I'll call you right back" and hopefully that's the end of that
I gotta hand it to 'em, they made sure I wouldn't feel that
They like "Let's build something bro" then they get real specific
And at this point I just hang up before they bring up logistics
Man my house has been built
I only got room for my family and friends
No room for guests, so you can't live up in it
And all these label guys tryna chop the number up like Samurais
Way more than [?], they gon' have you skinned alive
Feel so disrespected, I should get the double barrel
Tryna walk the straight and narrow but have you ever had some curly fries
Y'all act like y'all new to this, making me put up with foolishness
I sat up in the meeting, y'all didn't even know who Boosie is
Y'all didn't do your research
Y'all don't know how much I'm worth
They can't be hard, I made sure you can google this
Y'all hooligans
They tryna read my face like i don't know what mood he's in
I dropped Vegeta and did what they said I wouldn't do again
They thought the sauce was a fluke
That song had been broke the roof
A year later and they still jammin because it sounds brand new
I never tried to hide God, the whole time I stayed true
It ain't no secret, what he's done for others, he'll do for you
[?]
[Refrain]
They telling me that you can't have it all, you have to share the wealth
We gon' play keep away if you try to keep it for yourself
When the little man cuts out the middle, man, they put an X on Malcolm's hands so they can go and put an album on the shelf
The only problem is that if I leave then there is no one else
They tried to clone me like "Really, boy, you thought we couldn't tell?"
I lift my eyes up to the hills and then I ask God for help
And then I ask Him for forgiveness when they ask "how much for sale?"
"I need all of it, the home budget, the big numbers..."
The way we ball make 'em pause when they stop and
See them big commas, we walk around like emperors
If we ain't the GOATS then we some talking llamas with a new groove
All the money and all the clothes, the whole buffet and extra butter on the dinner roll still wouldn't be enough

Peace, bring it all to peace
The storm surrounding me
Let it break at Your name
[Verse 2]
Still, call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave at Your name

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Breathe, call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing
Once again, I will praise
