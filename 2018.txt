Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me
[Chorus]
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
O, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God, yeah

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
O, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine

I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours

What You say of me
I believe

Uh, last night put the heavy on me
Woke up and I'm feeling lonely
This world gotta a way of showing me (Showing me)
Some days it'll lift you up
Some days it'll call your bluff
Man, most of my days I ain't got enough

And all I know
Is You're my only hope (Woo)

Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me

Hold my heart when it's split right wide open
Turn these eyes to my sole protector

Keep humming when the song's through?
It's like
They're living life to a whole different tune
And have you ever met those that
Keep hoping when it's hopeless

They figured out what the rest haven't yet

Smile, like you just got away with something
Why?

So when you're standing in the rain again
You might as well be dancing

Uncontrollable, let the joy flow through, ha-ha

God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I
[Verse 2]
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I
So will I
[Bridge]
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
[Verse 3]
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart eight billion different ways
Every precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Had as much of you as I can take
I'm so done, so over being afraid
[Verse 1]
I've gone through the motions
I've been back and forth
I know that you're thinking you've heard this before
I don't know how to say it
So I'm just gonna say it, yeah
[Chorus]
Fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
[Verse 2]
Take a minute, let it settle in
You probably never saw it coming
Something's gotta give so I give up you, oh
There's no room for you here
Yeah, I've had enough
The no vacancy sign on my heart is lit up
In case you didn't hear it
Here it is again
[Chorus]
Oh, fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
[Bridge]
Is there anybody out there just like me?
(Anybody out there?)
Anybody needing fear to leave? (Ooo yeah)
If you don't know how to say it
Sing along with me
[Chorus]
Sing fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong, brave
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
Woah, goodbye, goodbye fear, woah
You will never be welcome here

It's so unusual it's frightening
You see right through the mess inside me
And you call me out to pull me in
You tell me I can start again
And I don't need to keep on hiding
[Chorus]
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You
I'm fully known and loved by You
[Verse 2]
It's so like You to keep pursuing
It's so like me to go astray
But You guard my heart with Your truth
A kind of love that's bullet proof
And I surrender to Your kindness
[Chorus]
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You

How real, how wide
How rich, how high is Your heart
I cannot find the reasons why
You give me so much
How real, how wide
How rich, how high is Your heart
I cannot find the reasons why
You give me so much

All my obsessions
I want to lay them all down
In Your hands
Only Your love is vital
Though I'm not entitled
Still You call me Your child
[Chorus]
God You don't need me
But somehow You want me
Oh how You love me
Somehow that frees me
To take my hands off of my life
And the way it should go

Oh how You love me
Somehow that frees me
To open my hands up
And give You control
Yeah, I give You control

Shattered and broken

Fall through my hands

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown
[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(I keep my head above water, above water)
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
[Bridge]
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep
[Chorus]
So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
[Outro]
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water

A lot of us grew up believing
At any moment we could lose it all
And at the drop of a hat
God might turn His back and move on
A lot of us feel like we blew it
Thinking that we're just too far gone
But I want you to know
There's still a hope for you now
[Chorus]
No matter what you've done
You can't erase His love
Nothing can change it
You're not separated
No matter what
[Verse 2]
There's never been a better time to get honest
There's never been a better time to get clean
So come as you are
Run to the cross and be free
Oh, be free
[Chorus]
No matter what you've done
You can't erase His love
Nothing can change it
You're not separated
No matter where you run
He's always holding on
You're still a daughter, you're still a son
No matter what
[Bridge]
Don't know what you've been taught
Don't know what you've been told
All I know is my God
Will never let go of you, no-o-o-ooo
And I don't know what you've seen
Don't know what you've been through
All I know is my God
Will never let go of you
He'll never let go
He'll never, never, never let you go

I came to You, with my heart in pieces
And found the God, with healing in His hands
I turned to You, put everything behind me
And found the God, who makes all things new
I look to You, drowning in my questions
And found the God, who holds all wisdom
And I trusted You, and stepped out on the ocean
You caught my hand among the waves
[Chorus]
'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days
[Verse 2]
I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows
And found the God, who relentlessly pursues
I hid from You, haunted by my failures
And found the God, whose grace still covers me
I fell on You, when I was at my weakest
And found the God, the lifter of my head
And I've worshipped You, and felt You right beside me
You're the reason that I sing
[Chorus]
'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise

You're the God of all my days

In my worry, God You are my stillness
In my searching, God You are my answers
In my blindness, God You are my vision
In my bondage, God You are my freedom
In my weakness, God You are my power
You're the reason that I sing

'Cause You are the God of all my days
Each step I take, You make a way
And I will give You all my praise

I push, I pull, go back and forth finding myself
Pounding on a locked door
I try to make it out alone without Your help
But I know I'll never win this war

I can never be, never be free without You
I can never be, never be me without You

I breathe the air of freedom in knowing my life
Is better off in Your hands
The past is gone, what's done is done, now I'm alive
And I'm never gonna look back

I don't wanna hear anymore, teach me to listen
I don't wanna see anymore, give me a vision
That you could move this heart, to be set apart
[Verse 2]
I don't need to recognize, the man in the mirror
And I don't wanna trade Your plan, for something familiar
I can't waste a day, I can't stay the same
[Chorus]
I wanna be different
I wanna be changed
'Til all of me is gone
And all that remains
Is a fire so bright
The whole world can see
That there's something different
So come and be different
In me!

And I don't wanna gain this world but lose what matters
And so I'm giving up, everything because...

How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Verse 2]
Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

On the nights when the dark last a little bit longer
When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
When the fear in my heart dips a little bit deeper
When my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker
[Pre-Chorus]
Where could I run to?
Where could I go?
[Chorus]
Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take
I know
You never let me go
And even when the waters won't stop rising
Even when I'm caught in the dead of a night
I know
No matter how it ends
You're with me even then
[Verse 2]
When the days up ahead look a little bit brighter
But the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter
I'm reminded Your grace never asks for perfection
Oh I'm restored 'cause I'm Yours and I stand forgiven
[Chorus]
Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take

And even when it's hard to remember
You alone are my defense when

You alone are my defense when
I'm standing on Your promises

My feet are frozen on this middle ground
The water's warm here but the fire's gone out
I played it safe for so long the passion left
Turns out safe is just another word for regret
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
We're all dying to live but we're all scared to death
And this is the part where my head tells my heart
You should turn back around but there's no turning back now
[Chorus]
I'm going all in
Headfirst into the deep end
I hear You calling
And this time the fear won't win
I'm going, I'm going all in

I believe that one day I will see Your kingdom come
And I wanna hear You say, "Welcome home my child, well done"

They say sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't
[Pre-Chorus]
It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Verse 2]
They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well, good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
‘Cause I know You're able
I know You can

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand

The outside looking in
This is where grace begins
We were hungry, we were thirsty
With nothing left to give
Oh the shape that we were in
Just when all hope seemed lost
Love opened the door for us
He said come to the table
Come join the sinners who have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free
Come to the table
Come meet this motley crew of misfits
These liars and these thieves
There's no one unwelcome here
So that sin and shame that you brought with you
You can leave it at the door
Let mercy draw you near
Come to the table
Come join the sinners who have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free
Come to the table
Come to the table
To the thief and to the doubter
To the hero and the coward
To the prisoner and the soldier
To the young and to the older
All who hunger, all who thirst
All the last and all the first
All the paupers and the princes
All who fail you've been forgiven
All who dream and all who suffer
All who loved and lost another
All the chained and all the free
All who follow, all who lead
Anyone who's been let down
All the lost you have been found
All who have been labeled right or wrong
To everyone who hears this song
Ooh
Come to the table
Come join the sinners you have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free

Just sit down and rest a while

God of creation
There at the start, before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I
So will I

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I, so will I

If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!
Whoa!

You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The Light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire?
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

Make it count, leave a mark, build a name for yourself
Dream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else
Make a name the world remembers
But all an empty world can sell is empty dreams

To make a name the world remembers
But Jesus is the only name to remember
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Verse 2]
All the kingdoms built, all the trophies won
Will crumble into dust when it's said and done
'Cause all that really matters
Did I live the truth to the ones I love?
Was my life the proof that there is only One
Whose name will last forever?
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember, ooh
Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Outro]
I, I don't want to leave a legacy

If grace was a kingdom, I stopped at the gate
Thinking I don’t deserve to pass through after all the mistakes that I’ve made
Oh, but I heard a whisper as Heaven bent down
Said, “Child, don’t you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown”
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
[Verse 2]
The pages of history they tell me it’s true
That it’s never the perfect; it’s always the ones with the scars that You use
Oh, it’s the rebels and the prodigals; it’s the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose, tell me there’s hope for sinners like me
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
I'm all Yours
[Outro]
Grace is a kingdom with gates open wide
There’s a seat at the table just waiting for you
So, come on inside

I've been taught how to talk to You
Hold it together
Make the bad look better
Say all the words that I'm supposed to
Bow my head, say, "Amen"
Yeah, that'll do
Making every dead-end look like heaven
Like being okay is the way to reach You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But You're not afraid of all the things I feel
So why am I afraid of being real?
[Chorus 1]
You want my tears, every messy word
Every scar and every fear
You want all I have
With no holding back
When I'm hurt, at my worst
You meet me there
'Cause You see the beauty
In my broken prayers!
In my broken prayers!
[Verse 2]
You don't care if it ain't poetry
'Cause all of my edges
They are a little rough
But that's all I got to bring

'Cause You're not afraid of all the things I feel
Don't have to hide the scars that still aren't healed

Mascara running down my face
Desperate cry in a dark place
You take me that way
All of me

You want my tears, every messy word
Every scar and every fear
You want all I have
With no holding back
When I'm hurt, at my worst
You meet me there
'Cause You see the beauty
In my broken prayers!
In my broken prayers!
In my broken prayers!
In my broken prayers!

It's a momma singing songs about the Lord
It's a daddy spending family time that the world said he cannot afford
These simple moments change the world
It's a pastor at a tiny little Church
Forty years of loving for the broken and the hurt
These simple moments change the world
[Chorus]
Dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
Dream small
[Verse 2]
It's visiting the widow down the street
Or dancing on a Friday with your friend with special needs
These simple moments change the world
Of course there's nothing wrong with bigger dreams
Just don't miss the minutes on your way, your bigger things
'Cause these simple moments change the world
[Chorus]
But dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
So dream small
[Bridge]
Keep loving, keep serving
Keep listening, keep learning
Keep praying, keep hoping
Keep seeking, keep searching
Out of these small things and watch them grow bigger
The God who does all things makes oceans… from river
[Chorus]
But dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
Yeah, 
five loaves and two fish's could feed them all
So dream small

Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin
Lost without hope with no place to begin
Your love made a way to let mercy come in
When death was arrested and my life began

Ash was redeemed only beauty remains
My orphan heart was given a name
My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance
When death was arrested and my life began

You have made me new, now life begins with You
It's Your endless love, pouring down on us
You have made us new, now life begins with You

Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more
My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore
He cancelled my debt and He called me His friend

You have made me new, now life begins with You

Darkness rejoiced as though heaven had lost

He tells the sun when to rise, gives the wind its breath
Swings a door wide open and moves in the moment you least expect

He's our rescuer (Hey!)
We are free from sin forevermore
Oh how sweet the sound (Hey!)
Oh how grace abounds (Hey!)
We will praise the Lord our rescuer (Hey!)
[Verse 2]
He is beauty for the blind man, riches for the poor
He is friendship for the one the world ignores
He is pasture for the weary, rest for those who strive
For the Good Lord is the way, the truth, the life
Yes the Good Lord is the way, the truth, the life (Hey!)

So come and be chainless
Come and be fearless
Come to the foot of Calvary
'Cause there is redemption
For every affliction
Here at the foot of Calvary
So come and be chainless (Come and be chainless)
Come and be fearless (Come and be fearless)
Come to the foot of Calvary
'Cause there is redemption
For every affliction (For every affliction)
Here at the foot of Calvary
[Chorus]
Ohh He's our rescuer (Hey!)
He's our rescuer (Hey!)
We are free from sin forevermore (We are free indeed)
Oh how sweet the sound (Hey!)
Oh how grace abounds (Hey!)
We will praise the Lord our rescuer
We will praise the Lord our rescuer (Hey!)

Heartbreak's a bitter sound
Know it well, it's ringing in my ears and I can't understand
Why I'm not fixed by now
Begged and I have pleaded, take this pain but I'm still bleeding

Heart trusts You for certain
Head says it's not working
I'm stuck here still hurting
But You tell me

You're making a masterpiece
You're shaping the soul in me
You're moving where I can't see

To finish Your work of art for all to see
You're making a masterpiece

Beautiful black and blue, painted in mercy's hue

What is this love that won't relent
That's calling out with heaven's breath
Who is reaching wide to save our souls?
Only You
What is this grace that makes no sense
That we could never recompense
Who gives us all a second chance?
Only You, only You, only You

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
There is no other God who can save
There is no one like our God

Who hung the stars upon the night
And showed the sun how bright to shine
Who shaped the world within His hands?
Only You
Who set the sky upon the hills
And told the waters to be still
Who spoke to form the universe
Only You, only You, only You

There is no one like our God

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clingin' to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waitin' for 'em to attack
They say "Don't get bitter, get better."
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm goin' through
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They say fear haunts and pain hates
I say pain strengthens and fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
And hopin' that I'll put together somethin' right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
No don't let the fear make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I – I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am
[Pre-Chorus 2: Tori Kelly]
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
Oh, I may have took some time
But now I realize
My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
There's not a hole too deep
That God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!
[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
Can you hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

Everything will just fall apart

I searched through the Earth for something that could satisfy
A peace for the hurt I had buried deep inside
Knees on the floor, I finally found everything I needed
You lifted my soul and opened up my eyes
[Chorus]
I never knew anything lasts forever
Till I found You, till I found You
I never dreamed anything could be better
Till I found You, till I found You
You're rewriting my story
And I'm brand new like a morning
Oh, I never knew anything lasts forever
Till I found You
Till I, till I found You

Till I, till I found You

Gone are the days I'm chasing after what won't last
I'm done with building these castles that crumble like sand
Oh, knees on the floor
I finally found that everything I needed was always right in front of me
You gave me a name and you changed everything I am

I never knew anything lasts forever
Till I found You, till I found You

Word of life
Speak to my weary heart
Strengthen my broken parts
Lead me to Your open arms
Word of truth
Illuminate all these lies
The enemy speaks inside
In freedom I will rise
[Chorus]
'Cause You called me out from the grave
So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in
Your word of life

Spirit of God
Take me to a deeper place
Take me out of what is safe
I will not be afraid
Spirit of God
Fill me with joy again
Springing up from within
It cannot be contained

When you're hurting, feeling shame
When you're numbing all your pain
When you've lost your way
And feel so far away
You're not

You're beautifully broken
And You can be whole again
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy

For who you are no matter what
When you're stumbling, with each step
And you're haunted by regret
And the darkness closes in
Just listen

Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
I've been down this road before
Now I know which way to go
You can try to drag me down
But I'll be living in the clouds
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now
[Chorus: Jordan Feliz]
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta
[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, I want it like I need to breathe
Yeah, make it clear like I need to see (Woo)
As a kid, mama told me sky's the limit
'Til you hit it like Ken Griffey to the fences
Out the park, hit and run, that's my drive (That's my drive)
It's a vibe, been that way all my life, yeah
I shut it down, when I shine with the crew
Yeah, I ride with the crew
Gave my life to the truth, testify
Walk on water like the Son of man
Understand I'll never drown (Splash)
Take a hit and never quit (Woo)
Might be down but never out
There are days that I fail (Fail)
And the trains off the rail (Rail)
Through the pain we prevail (Pow)
Tell 'em you just gotta live

Keep on living 'til there's nothing left
Lean on we just like there's no one else
Ain't nobody out here more like You
And with You they broke mold
Ain't no more like You that for sure
I can't drop out like the top down on the coupe
Tell 'em watch out when I walk out, make 'em move
Sunday morning with my hands up (Hands up)
Like they got the handcuffs (Handcuffs)
Searching for some answers
Since mama passed from cancer and my sister left Seattle with a one way ticket home
Hope she holding Chase and teaching him to speak Samoan
Gotta keep it going
Yeah, that's all they told me
Tell him you can make it when you know the one and only

Burning bright beyond the fire
You were born to win, yeah, you're a fighter
Don't let your light just fade away

So many hurting, so many lost
With all this striving, who can we lean on?
Creation's crying, out from the dark

The one solution, to every fear
I know my help and where it comes from

And in our weakness, He is strong
He holds the weight of, all of our failings
Great is our sin but greater the cross

The one solution, to every fear

For every soul that's shaking
For every sickness, there's healing in Your hands

And how many hours must we wait through to hear the truth
How many moments did I trade in, for a fake kiss
How many chances did I forfeit, too afraid to miss

Rolling like rivers, running with grace

Oh when we're standing, standing

How many lives in the rear view, do I compare to

There is a wrestling in my heart and my mind
A disturbance and a tension I cannot seem to drive
And if I'm honest, there's quite a bit of fear
To sit here in this silence and really hear You

What will You ask of me?
Will I listen to Your voice when You speak?
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me

Sometimes things, they are black and white
Sometimes they are not and that leaves us torn inside
And in the middle, we are left to wonder
Who we are, what You want and where we're going

Oh such a mystery
I don't always understand
But I believe!

Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me

I don't know the future, it's one day at a time
But I know I'll be okay with Your hand holding mine
So take all my resistance
Oh God I need Your grace
One step and then the other
Show me the way
Show me the way!

Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I, I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
[Verse 2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved!
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first, oh, how I first believed
[Verse 3]
Now when we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun!
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun!

I thought by now I would get it
His love for me is unmeasured
Still feel like I could do better
Was paralyzed by depression
But heaven and earth came together
And You came to my rescue
I use my voice as a weapon
On earth like it's in heaven
Yeah, I never handle things too well
But I was made to fly, not to fail
I don't need man's approval
When God sent me to bring heaven
Down for the kids going through hell
Yeah, we gon' make it
I don't care what the world's been saying
It's time to step up, not cave in
The grace He gave us, amazing
A love that could conquer the hatred
But it's up to us
A new generation to show His love
From the ends of the earth to the day He comes
[Chorus: Tauren Wells]

Okay, we turned the stage to an altar at the last show
Something about when you know you’re being impactful
Using the tools I was given but being tactful
Went from the pit to raps inside of a mac full
With the power size of a Mack truck
I went through the hard times, no bad luck
Graduated cap, gown with the tassle
Now I make art like Basel
But I still keep it classic like a left eye rhyme
Big Poppa like the Bed Stuy guy
I got the dirt off my shoulders like Jay in his prime
I stood on my own two like the veterans taught
If I ever lay down, let it be for some rest
And whenever I'm recharged, let me be at my best
So whenever I’m pouring out all your love to the rest
Now you can go and tell them the rest
[Chorus: Tauren Wells]
This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah
This is our war cry, we'll rise up

Copy For so long I carried the weight of my past
Cripple by burdens like stones on my back
I thought I had fallen too far from your grace
But you came and showed me the way
When I was lost soul searching
You were the ground beneath my feet
When I was blind man begging
You were the eyes so I could see
When the smoke was rising up
You were the air that I could breath
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Now all I can see are the fields of your grace
Wherever I run your leading the way
You shook the shackles off my feet
I found redemption on my knees
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night
O night divine
[Verse 2]
Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine

Could've made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure
But it made me richer
Yeah, being broke made me rich
And being low made you quit
But being low made me high
Take time if you want this, let's go!
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Money may have made me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use your muscle, learn to grind, and keep your mind up on the future, man
We came out them trenches
Government assistance in the beginning
Keep them cans for the pennies
We saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wondering what I got, and wondering how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty-handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay the lawyer fee, but it's all good, the squad pitching in
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

Hey, you
In the corner shaking in those boots
You got one, one for two
You got the shaking right, but the fear won't do
We always say that we have unspeakable joy
So let our feet do all the talking when our words fall short
[Chorus]
We've got reason to get up
Reason to get down
He done traded our sin for joy
And now, that joy wants out
Happy dance 
(oh!)
Happy dance 
(oh!)
[Verse 2]
Hey, yeah you
In the back of the room with those concrete shoes
It's okay, to cut loose
Oh, it ain't about how you move, but what moves you
We're so consumed with what we think we're supposed to be
That we stop living like we know that we're free
[Chorus]
We've got reason to get up
Reason to get down
He done traded our sin for joy
And now, that joy wants out
Happy dance 
(oh!)
Happy dance 
(oh!)

Let me see, those hands
If the good Lord saved ya
Get up, get down
'Cause He done changed ya
Let me see, those hands
If the good Lord saved ya
Get up, get down
'Cause He done changed ya!
[Chorus]
We've got reason to get up
Reason to get down
He done traded our sin for joy
And now, that joy wants out
Happy dance 
(oh!)
Happy dance
