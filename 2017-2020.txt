[Verse 1]
You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ
[Chorus 1]
What a beautiful Name it is
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Verse 2]
You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus You brought heaven down
My sin was great Your love was greater
What could separate us now?
[Chorus 2]
What a wonderful Name it is
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a wonderful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Interlude]
[Bridge 1]
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again...
[Bridge 2]
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
[Chorus 3]
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
[Bridge 2]
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
[Chorus 3]
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus...
[Outro]
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus!

Copy [Verse 1]
They say sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't
[Pre-Chorus]
It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Verse 2]
They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well, good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Bridge]
You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
‘Cause I know You're able
I know You can
[Chorus]
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
[Outro]
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

Copy [Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clingin' to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waitin' for 'em to attack
They say "Don't get bitter, get better."
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm goin' through
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They say fear haunts and pain hates
I say pain strengthens and fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
And hopin' that I'll put together somethin' right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
No don't let the fear make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I – I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies
If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside
There's a better life, there's a better life
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker
[Verse 2]
We've all searched for the light of day in the dead of night
We've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fight
We've all run to things we know just ain't right
When there's a better life, there's a better life
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker
[Bridge]
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify, testify
If you believe it, if you receive it
If you can feel it, somebody testify
[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

If you got chains, He's a chain breaker

Oh, my soul
Oh, how you worry
Oh, how you're weary from fearing
You lost control
This was the one thing
You didn't see coming
And no one would blame you though
If you cried in private
If you tried to hide it away
So no one knows
No one will see
If you stop believing
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone
[Verse 2]
Here and now
You can be honest
I won't try to promise
That someday it all works out
'Cause this is the valley
And even now
He is breathing on your dry bones
And there will be dancing
There will be beauty where beauty was
Ash and stone
This much I know
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
[Bridge]
I'm not strong enough
I can't take anymore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
And my shipwrecked faith
Will never get me to shore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
Can he find me here?
Can he keep me, from going under?
[Chorus]
Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone

Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?

I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days

And I've prayed prayers to heaven
From my lowest place
And I have held Your blessings
God, You give and take away

No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown, where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep,
 
my faith will stand
[Chorus]
And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
[Verse 2]
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now
[Chorus]
So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine, oh
(And You are mine, oh)

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Saviour
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Keep my eyes above the waves

I was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze
Singin' like a song through the tall oak trees
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
[Verse 2]
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered to You, You
Uh, You were there, You heard my prayer
In that broke-down, dusty room
It was the first time I said, "I'm Yours"
The first time I called You "Lord"
[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
[Bridge]
Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song through the oak trees
Pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built, opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that was headed to my heart
But You hit the mark
[Chorus]
When love broke through 
(Love)
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert 
(Desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken 
(Thank you, Jesus)
And it all began with You 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert 
(Desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken 
(Chains are broken)
And it all began with You
When love broke through
(It all began with You, it all began with You)
And it all began with You
When love broke through
(It all began with You, Jesus)
[Outro]
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me

This world is not what it was meant to be
All this pain, all this suffering
There’s a better place waiting for me
In heaven
[Verse 2]
Every tear will be wiped away
Every sorrow and sin erased
We’ll dance on seas of amazing grace
In heaven, in heaven
I'm going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
Home
[Verse 3]
Lay down my burdens, I lay down my past
I run to Jesus, no turning back
Thank God Almighty, I’ll be free at last
In heaven, in heaven
I'm going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
[Bridge]
Blinded eyes
Will finally see
The dead will rise
On the shores of eternity
The trump will sound
The angels will sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I am going
[Chorus]
Home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I’m in Your open arms
Where I belong
Where I belong

If grace was a kingdom, I stopped at the gate
Thinking I don’t deserve to pass through after all the mistakes that I’ve made
Oh, but I heard a whisper as Heaven bent down
Said, “Child, don’t you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown”
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
[Verse 2]
The pages of history they tell me it’s true
That it’s never the perfect; it’s always the ones with the scars that You use
Oh, it’s the rebels and the prodigals; it’s the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose, tell me there’s hope for sinners like me
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
I'm all Yours
[Outro]
Grace is a kingdom with gates open wide
There’s a seat at the table just waiting for you
So, come on inside

As I walk this great unknown
Questions come and questions go
Was there purpose for the pain?
Did I cry these tears in vain?
[Verse 2]
I don't want to live in fear
I want to trust that You are near
Trust Your grace can be seen
In both triumph and tragedy
[Chorus]
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
[Verse 3]
But sometimes my faith feels thin
Like the night will never end
Will You catch every tear
Or will You just leave me here?
[Chorus]
But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
[Bridge]
So, whatever happens I will not be afraid
Cause You are closer than this breath that I take
You calm the storm when I hear You call my name
I still believe that one day I'll see Your face
[Chorus]
And I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

You're with me and You won't let go

Not scared to say it
I used to be the one
Preaching it to you
That you could overcome
I still believe it
But it ain't easy
'Cause that world I painted
Where things just all work out
It started changing
And I started having doubts
And it got me so down
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I picked myself back up
And I started telling me
No, my God's not done
Making me a masterpiece
He's still working on me

He started something good and I'm gonna believe it
He started something good and He's gonna complete it
So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through
I'm just unfinished

So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through

And the kind of God He is
He might make it a mystery
But He's proving I can trust in Him
And yeah, I believe it

Trading punches with the heart of darkness
Going to blows with your fear incarnate
Never gone until it's stripped away
A part of you has gotta die to change
[Verse 2]
In the morning you gon' need an answer
Ain't nobody gonna change the standard
It's not enough to just feel the flame
You've gotta burn your old self away

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It take some time to make your courage strong

A restless generation
We're turning over every stone
Hoping to find salvation
In a world that's left us cold
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
[Verse 2]
It's the cure for our condition
It's the good news for us all
It's greater than religion
It's the power of the Cross
[Pre-Chorus]
So can we get back to the altar?
Back to the arms of our first love
There's only one way to the Father
And He's calling out to us
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night

The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way
[Spoken Word]
The amazing news of the Gospel
Is not that we can receive Jesus into our lives
But that He's already received us
Into​ His
[Bridge]
In my own life, it means forgiveness
When I know I deserved the fall
It called me out of my darkness
And carried me to the Cross
In a moment, my eyes were opened
In that moment, my heart was changed
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
Ohh!..
[Chorus]
To the captive, it looks like freedom
To the orphan, it feels like home
To the skeptic, it might sound crazy
To believe in a God who loves
In a world, where our hearts are breaking
And we're lost in the mess we've made
Like a blinding light, in the dead of night
It's the Gospel
The Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way
It's the Gospel that makes a way!
It's the Gospel that makes a way

Head full of questions, how can you measure up?
To deserve affection, to ever be enough
For this existence, when did it get so hard?
Your heart is beating, alive and breathing
And there's a reason why
You are essential, not accidental
And you should realize

It pulls you under, and you just fall away

But there's a purpose under the surface
And you don't have to drown
Let me remind you, that love will find you
Let it lift you out

After the heartache of wrong turns and sidetracks
Just when they think they've got you game set match

Just when they think there's nothing left running on empty

Word of life
Speak to my weary heart
Strengthen my broken parts
Lead me to Your open arms
Word of truth
Illuminate all these lies
The enemy speaks inside
In freedom I will rise
[Chorus]
'Cause You called me out from the grave
So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in
Your word of life
(Your word of life)

Spirit of God
Take me to a deeper place
Take me out of what is safe
I will not be afraid
Spirit of God
Fill me with joy again
Springing up from within
It cannot be contained

'Cause You called me out from the grave
So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in

Only Your love remains
I am alive today
'Cause You called me out, ooh
You called me out, ooh

Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living colour
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

In the air of second life
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind

Turning wilderness to wonder

Through the eyes of men it seems there's so much we have lost
As we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked
One by one the enemy has whispered lies and led them off as slaves
[Verse 2]
But we know that You are God, Yours is the victory
We know there is more to come that we may not yet see
So with the faith You've given us, 
we step into the valley unafraid, yeah
[Chorus]
As we call out to dry bones, "Come alive, come alive"
We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"
[Verse 3]
God of endless mercy, God of unrelenting love
Rescue every daughter, bring us back the wayward sons
And by Your spirit breathe upon them
Show the world that You alone can save
You alone can save
[Chorus]
As we call out to dry bones, "Come alive, come alive"
We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"

So breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe, oh breath of God
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe, oh breath of God
Breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe

We call out to dead hearts, "Come alive, come alive"
Up out of the ashes, let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones, "Come alive"

We call out to dry bones, "Come alive… oh come alive"

I've been trying to make sense of the sorrow that I feel
Holding on for life to the only thing that's real
I've only scratched the surface, I've barely had a taste
But just a glimpse draws my heart to change
And one sight of You lays my sin to waste
I don't need to see everything just more of You
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
[Verse 2]
My sight is incomplete and I've made You look small
I've been staring at my problems for way too long
Re-align where my hope is set, until You're all that's left
But just a glimpse draws my heart to change
And one sight of You lays my sin to waste
I don't need to see everything just more of You
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You

Oh God be greater, than the worries in my life
Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind
Be louder, let your Glory come alive
Be magnified
Oh God be greater, than the worries in my life
Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind
Be louder, let your Glory come alive
Be magnified
[Chorus]
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes
To You, to You
Take it all, take it all away
Magnify no other name
Open up, open up my eyes

Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away

Of the innocent dying

Are you not afraid?

You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying

Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world back to God

I tried to fit you in the walls inside my mind
I try to keep you safely inbetween the lines
I try to put you in the box that I've designed
I try to pull you down so we are eye to eye
[Chorus]
When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world?
I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world
How could I make you so small
When you're the one who holds it all
When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world

Just a whisper of your voice can tame the seas
So who am I to try to take the lead
Still I run ahead and think I'm strong enough
When you're the one who made me from the dust

Copy We're all related
Brothers and strangers
The king and the beggar bleed the same
We've all got a sickness
A terminal condition
We medicate it
But the pain won't go away
See the eyes of a million faces
Lookin' for it in a million places
Only one can save us, Jesus
You are the cure
Everybody's searching for it
Everybody's reaching out
Trying to grab a hold of something real
You are the cure
Only you can satisfy us
Fill up the void inside us
Never been a heart you couldn't heal
You are the cure
You are the doctor
Healer and father
To the orphan without a home
We fell into darkness
We were lost till you found us
You're the remedy we're looking for
You are the cure for the broken
The hope for a hopeless world
The meaning the purpose
The peace that will make us whole
You don't have to search no more

I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up
[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you
[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there
[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say

Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down

Cause that's what I do, thats what I do

To let go of what you're holding to
It's too late, too far
You're too small, it's too hard
Throwing water on that spark
Living deep inside your heart
With oceans of reasons
The things you're not seeing
But oh, maybe they don't
Know what you know
That you're not alone

Don't you be afraid

So step into the fight
He's right there by your side
The stones inside your hand might be small
But watch the giants fall

Can't you imagine it
So bold, so brave
With childlike faith
Miracles could happen
Mountains would start moving
So whatever you may face

Don't you be afraid
Of giants in your way

So step into the fight
He's right there by your side

We trust the name of Jesus!

You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

In love and justice You remain
Every knee will bow
We bring our expectations
Our hope is anchored in Your name
The name of Jesus!
We trust the name of Jesus!!

You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious

We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus
From age to age You reign
Your kingdom has no end
We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus
From age to age You reign
Your kingdom has no end!
[Chorus 2]
You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, forevermore!..
You are the only King forever
Almighty God, we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious!!!
Victorious!!

Mirror mirror, mirror on the wall
Tellin' those lies, pointing out your flaws
That isn’t who you are
That isn’t who you are
[Verse 2: Joel]
It might be hard to hear, but let me tell you, dear
If you could see what I can see, I know you would believe
That isn’t who you are
There’s more to who you are
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
So when it’s late, you’re wide awake
Too much to take
Don’t you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave, hear me say
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)
[Verse 3: Joel]
No matter what you’ve heard, this is what you're worth
More than all the money or the diamonds and pearls
Oh, this is who you are
Yeah, this is who you are
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
So when it’s late, you’re wide awake
Too much to take
Don’t you dare forget that in the pain
You can be brave, hear me say
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)

Sisters, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Love, we can start again
Brothers, we can start again
Give honor till the end
Yeah, we can start again
[Chorus]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (oh so priceless)
(You're) Irreplaceable, unmistakable, incomparable
Darling, it’s beautiful
I see it all in you (oh so priceless)
[Outro]
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you (we can start again)
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
Oh so priceless

God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I
[Verse 2]
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I
So will I
[Bridge]
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
[Verse 3]
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die
[Chorus 3]
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart eight billion different ways
Every precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I
[Tag]
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

There is a wrestling in my heart and my mind
A disturbance and a tension I cannot seem to drive
And if I'm honest, there's quite a bit of fear
To sit here in this silence and really hear You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What will You ask of me?
Will I listen to Your voice when You speak?
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes things, they are black and white
Sometimes they are not and that leaves us torn inside
And in the middle, we are left to wonder
Who we are, what You want and where we're going
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh such a mystery
I don't always understand
But I believe!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Bridge]
I don't know the future, it's one day at a time
But I know I'll be okay with Your hand holding mine
So take all my resistance
Oh God I need Your grace
One step and then the other
Show me the way
Show me the way!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
God help me

I believe that You are God alone
But sometimes I still try to take control
'Cause I get scared when I can't see the end
And all You want from me is to let go

You're parting waters, making a way for me
You're moving mountains that I don't even see
You've answered my prayer, before I even speak
All You need for me to be is still

I bring my praise before I bring my need
'Cause there's no fear You've not already seen
I rest my heart on all Your promises
'Cause I have seen and know Your faithfulness

Copy DOUG HANNAH: Well hey, I'm Doug Hannah, and I think you're gonna recognize these guys: Peter Furler, Michael Tait, Newsboys United. Guys, welcome.
MICHAEL TAIT: Thank you.
PETER FURLER: Thanks, Doug.
HANNAH: Well, congratulations on the record.
TAIT: Thank you, Doug.
HANNAH: Excellent stuff, and, uh, I, I really would like to know... Uh, Peter, I'll start with you, since you kinda came back: What led you to wanna rejoin, or reform, with Newsboys United?
FURLER: Well, you know, the boys started working on a song called "The Cross Has The Final Word," and uh, they just kinda called up and said, "Would you like to, you know, be a part of it? Maybe just produce the track and, and see what you do to it?" And so I went into the studio, and uh, I sung down a guide vocal, and they really dug it and they're like "Hey, can we keep you on this track?" You know, and I was like "Yeah," so next minute we're doing kind of a, a guest vocal thing, featuring, you know, myself.
FURLER: You know, when you're working together, you start to have conversations more and, and uh, we started chatting about what would it look like to have the two eras of the band tour at the same time, and uh, I think—you know, Michael and I, we've discussed this, we—before it started, we didn't know if it was gonna work, or how it was gonna work. In fact, I think we only booked a certain amount of dates.
TAIT: Just in case.
HANNAH: Just to try it out, yeah.
FURLER: Yeah, if it didn't work, we could all escape, and uh... [Hannah and Tait laughing] But uh, but it worked really well, you know, it was great. And we've loved it, and then, you know, moving forward, it's morphed into something completely different. It's really, we've uh, we've obviously done shows together now, we've done about 120 shows, and we're kind of, uh, keeping each other on more on stage, like "Mike, can you sing on this?"
HANNAH: Yep, and the next step now is you're all gonna get an apartment building and just live communally.
FURLER: Well we will, we'll be living back where we started out, that's what we—no, we're actually gonna get a van down by the riverside. [All three laughing]
HANNAH: Was this all your bright idea, Mike?
TAIT: No, of course not, bro, no.
FURLER: Just say yes! [Hannah and Furler laughing]
HANNAH: "Of course not!"
TAIT: But what's cool about [?] is, it's, it's like a superband now, you know?
HANNAH: It is.
TAIT: And Peter and I go back way back, back in the days with K Max, are our besties and Tobymac, back one day, we did the Nu Skool Jam.
FURLER: That's right.
TAIT: Touring together, we had no clue we'd be together, and it's been an absolute pleasure and joy. I love this man, and I've had a great time on stage.
HANNAH: But everybody's great friends, brothers, and, and it's just, families are tight.
TAIT: Amen.
HANNAH: But what were, you must have had some... mixed emotions a little bit? I mean, you left for a reason. Nine years fast-forward, you're back in, did you have to wrestle with any of that, or was it just like "Nope, I'm in, let's do it"?
FURLER: Coming back, I didn't really have to wrestle because we had, it was a slow process of kind of—
TAIT: Very subtle.
FURLER: Yeah, just kind of working on the song together and kinda hanging like we're hanging now.
TAIT: And the best part about it, to be honest—and the best part, and kinda the weirdest part is that—let's face it, Peter started this thing years ago when I started DC Talk with Tobymac. I'm more concerned about how it's gonna work, as opposed to how I feel.
HANNAH: What is so—just as an outsider—what is so impressive to me about it, looking at it from a distance a little bit, is, th-this, this unity that you have, I think you can feel it in the concert for sure,
TAIT: No question.
HANNAH: I think you can feel it in the records, I think it sends a really good message. And I feel, when I look at it—
TAIT: And you can't fake it from stage, people—
HANNAH: Of course not.
TAIT: People can feel the difference. They feel—when you're on stage, you're getting along with each other, you're lovin' each other—you can't fake the funk, baby. They know what's up. They get it.
FURLER: That's right.
HANNAH: You—l-let's stop and—"You can't fake the funk, baby"?
FURLER: My favorite saying. [Tait cracking up]
HANNAH: That's an important—
FURLER: That's trademarked, by the way.
TAIT: Trademarked, that's right.
HANNAH: Get the lawyers on that right now.
FURLER: TM.
HANNAH: So people just checked out the Newsboys United record, now they're like, "I wanna see Newsboys United on tour." We know it's gonna be a lot of fun, we know it's gonna be high-energy. What is something that might surprise people if they come check you out on tour?
FURLER: Uh, there's, there is one thing I really appreciate with all of the guys, is there is a gratefulness. We don't...
TAIT: Yes!
FURLER: We kinda know who we are, and we don't have...
TAIT: Thank you Jesus.
FURLER: We, we, you know, we, we can have a meal in Nashville at a restaurant and there are probably ten musicians in that restaurant serving the food that are way better than we are, or, you know...
TAIT: That's a fact!
FURLER: So there's a gratefulness of, man, there's so many people, talented people, that are on tour we see, we see people that are rising up and some that are doing different things, but we are grateful.
TAIT: And one thing I've always loved about Newsboys, before I joined and even now in being in the band, is back in the day, Toby and I would look at Newsboys' production. Their shows were always over the top. I'm like, "How can these guys afford this?" And now, I'm in the band, and sometimes we still can't afford it but we do it anyway. [Hannah and Furler laughing] And, our shows are second to none as far as production too.
HANNAH: That's the truth.
TAIT: So I'm gonna have the production side down, Pete, and the musical side down, God on board, what more can you say?
HANNAH: Yep, there you go. I-I know hope, I know the gospel, I know, I know w—those are the themes of the record. But if, is the—is there a preeminent message or theme that people are gonna get when they, when they listen through track-by-track to Newsboys United?
FURLER: Yeah, I think they're gonna be encouraged, you know. And um, and they're gonna feel unity. Right now we're living in a country, and a world, that is very divided, and maybe getting more so. Um, uh, so I think they'll sense a unity, and they'll feel encouraged. I think uh, I think the one thing about Newsboys music that has always been its constant, you know, it's tried different things and different instruments and different arrangements and things but there's always a, a joy to it.
HANNAH: One final personal question for each of you: what is the preeminent thing that God is teaching/showing/revealing to you in this season of your life right now? Personally, now.
FURLER: I think for me, um... Not to weigh yourself out to get rich, have the wisdom to show restraint. The borrower is slave to the lender, you know. I think for me, um, you know, growing up in coming from a middle class, lower-middle class family, and then coming into a lot of success, I got caught up in material things. And so the last decade, last—it's just been living a simple life. And it's more the practical things that are in the Bible. A lot of times we get hyped up on, uh, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Well, you can't if you're in debt up to your eyeballs, know what I mean? [Hannah laughing] So, it's just some practical things. There's a lot of practical things in the Proverbs, and uh, that really speak to me at this time.
HANNAH: Tait, man, what about you?
TAIT: Wow, Pete, how can I follow that?
HANNAH: Yeah, go ahead and try though.
TAIT: Bishop Furler over there. [Hannah laughing] Um, a lot of people are, are kind of shocked by this when I say it, and thinking, "well you're Michael Tait, you know, you're DC Talk, you're this guy, you're that Christian, blah blah blah." But it turns out that every day I'm human, and my humanness makes me doubt my faith sometimes, makes me doubt that God actually loves me. So in this season, I spend a lot of time in the Word. I spend, I mean, there's, probably not a day goes by where I don't actually read the Word and get into it. The Word I know so well, but I read, study the concordance and, and all the commentary on it. I read about a God that loves me so deeply—and it's hard to grasp sometimes, 'cause I've [?] lovin' myself sometimes. But I know God loves me that much, I can then walk out the house, accept the fact that I don't have this or that or I might lack here or there, but it's not about that. It's about knowing the Savior, vertical. "Love God," first commandment, "and love your neighbor as yourself."
HANNAH: Well said. The cross demonstrates what you're talking about too, so amen to that. Well it's been a privilege for me, over a few decades now, to, to watch you all in your various endeavors and to play you on the radio and cheer you on and talk to you.
FURLER: Thank you, Doug.
TAIT: You-you're my favorite, Doug, also, you're my favorite guy. Doug Hannah.
HANNAH: Well thank you, thank you very much. I really appreciate that. I, I, I'm thankful too for everybody who has listened to this. If, if you haven't listened to the record yet, go back, hit track 1. Come see Newsboys United in concert, uh, i-it, you will—especially if you don't know, like, you'll walk out of there and you're gonna be like, "Wow, I cannot believe what I just saw." You, uh—s-suffice it to say, you get a lot for your money when you go see the Newsboys. And God just might use the music to change your life, so. Check out newsboys.com for the tour stop closest to you. Thanks for listening. Thanks Michael, thanks Peter.
FURLER: Thanks Doug.
TAIT: Thanks Doug.
HANNAH: I'm Doug Hannah, Newsboys United.

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen

Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

What if you could go back
And relive one day of your life all over again
And unmake the mistake
That left you a million miles away
From the you, you once knew
Now yesterday's shame
Keeps saying that you'll never get back on track
But what if I told you

You're one step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone
You're one step away

It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Mercy says
You don't have to keep running down the road you're on
Love's never met a lost cause
Your shame, lay it down
Leave your ghosts in the past
'Cause you know that you can't go back
But you can turn around
You've never been more than

One step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open

Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

So come on home, come on home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name
Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're just one step away

Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't it just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything
[Chorus 1]
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts too much to see
Keep your eyes on me
[Verse 2]
Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun
[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me
[Bridge]
You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

California drivin’ had to get out
Distance got me wonderin’ where You are right now
One-way conversations
 got me worn down
Pouring out my heart wish You would speak a sound
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost
I don’t know what I’m after
I don’t know what I’m doin’
I don’t know what I’m after
All I know is I’m lost
[Chorus]
Without Your love
There’s no point in even wakin’ up
No, no, no, no
Without Your love
Nothin’s ever gonna be enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
I can’t get you outta my head
And I don’t wanna ever forget
You give me what the world could never give
I can’t live without Your love
[Verse 2]
Starin’ at the ceiling after midnight
Over-thinkin’ everything in my whole life
All of these regrets are clouding my mind
Lord I need the strength to try it one more time
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cuz now I know what I’m after
Now I know what I’m doin’
Now I know what I’m after

What I want is You
I can’t live without Your love

I was buried beneath my shame
Who could carry that kind of weight
It was my tomb
Till I met You
[Verse 2]
I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb
Till I met You

You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness

Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all I know
The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave

I needed rescue
My sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
I needed shelter
I was an orphan
Now You call me a citizen of heaven
When I was broken
You were my healing
Your love is the air that I'm breathing
I have a future
My eyes are open
[Chorus]
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness

How many times can one heart break?
It was never supposed to be this way
Look in the mirror, but you find someone you never thought you'd be
Oh, but I can still recognize
The one I love in your tear stained eyes
I know you might not see him now, so lift your eyes to me
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Verse 2]
You see your worst mistake
But I see the price I paid
There's nothing you could ever do, to lose what grace has won
So hold on, it's not the end
No, this is where love's work begins
I'm making all things new
And I will make a miracle of you
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Bridge]
I see my child, my beloved
The new creation you're becoming
You see the scars from when you fell
But I see the stories they will tell
You see worthless, I see priceless
You see pain, but I see a purpose
You see unworthy, undeserving
But I see you through eyes of mercy
[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
You're not too far gone
You're one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet, no
When you see wounded, I see mended
[Outro]
Ooh, I see mended
Woah, oh I see mended
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended

In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
[Verse 1]
When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet
Between the black skies, and my red eyes, I can barely see
When I realize I've been sold out by my friends and my family
I can feel the rain reminding me
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
[Verse 2: GabeReal]
Mmm, when my hopes and dreams are far from me
And I'm runnin' out of faith
I see the future I picture slowly fade away
And when the tears of pain and heartache
Are pouring down my face
I find my peace in Jesus' name
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm (yeah, yeah)
You remain in control (yes you do, Lord)
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me (Your love surrounds me)
In the eye of the storm (in the eye of the storm)
[Verse 3]
When the test comes in and the doctor says
I've only got a few months left
It's like a bitter pill I'm swallowing
I can barely take a breath
And when addiction steals my baby girl
And there's nothing I can do
My only hope is to trust You
I trust You, Lord
[Chorus]
In the eye of the storm
You remain in control
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
You remain in control
In the middle of the war
You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm
Oh, in the eye of
Lord, in the eye of the storm
I know You're watching me, yeah
Ay

When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone, Lord)
When my flesh is failing
You're still holding on, oh whoa
When the storm is raging (the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and all my hope is gone)
When my flesh is failing (my flesh is failing)
You're still holding on, ooh
When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone)
Even when my flesh is failing (flesh is failing)
You're still holding on, holding on

The Lord is my Shepherd
I have all that I need
He let's me rest in green meadows
He leads me beside peaceful streams
He renews my strength
He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to His Name
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid
For You are close beside me

My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house
Hey!
[Chorus]
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Woo!)
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Oh yeah!)
All I spit is real life (Real life) (Yeah!)

Yeah
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average."
He asked me, "What does that mean?"
I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please."
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time
Oh yeah!

Wonder if I'll ever amount to much
Seems like no matter what I do
It's never gonna be good enough
Should I just give up?
Lord, I need to hear You speak
Tell me I am loved
Tell me I am known
That You died for me
I am not alone
Tell me I'm Your child
The one Your heart beats for
I can find my strength
Knowing I am Yours
You've always known what my heart needs
And You tell me
You wrote Your name upon my heart
You knew me before my life began
You still have a plan
And when I'm starting to forget
Jesus, You tell me who I am
Who I am
You tell me I am loved
Tell me I am known
And that You died for me
I am not alone
You tell me I'm Your child

I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to feel at home
I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone (Yeah)
I got an issue with people pretending they like what they don't
Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah, it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though
I don't care if I am on the billboards
On a killing spree, I'm about to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord
 (Haha)
We just getting warmed up
Yeah, I said I was coming, I warned ya
So close to the fans, 
I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime? 
They come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now, but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins (Yeah)
We ain't talked in like six years, why you writing me now?
I just turned a 100k down, just to keep the brand looking right, now (That's real)
I ain't bragging about the money, I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account
Or the bank amounts, I'm a business man
But don't touch my money, I don't play around, woo!
Lights out when the mic's out
About to hit the West Coast, hype crowds
I just put a record out, what you think I'm gonna pipe down?
Nah, I've been looking for a beat, look what I found, woo!
I mean everything is coming out of my mouth
Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh yeah? Well, tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done though
What's coming next year? 
Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow, anybody wanna be the one
To make an issue out of nothing? I'ma hit you with my iPhone
I know, I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't looking for a handout
You ain't like what I was doing last year which is funny
'Cause you lookin' like a fan now, are you a fan now?
I kinda miss being broke, 
now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school and hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper, they smiled and looked at me, "Okay
That's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job." Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that will bring up your name for nothing
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude, but I could get you on my worst days
Say nothing for me, do it all the time
Yeah they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, "Who am I?"
Now this year they like, "You the guy"
Here's a little some' for your car rides
If they said I fell off, they all lied
Yeah, you know the logo, better recognize
Yeah, it's Real Music 'til the day we die,

Like castles of sand, castles of sand
My fear, like an enemy army
Is marching again, but I'm making a stand

I’m scared I’ve started to forget
Your body and your ticking head
But I’ll clutch straws as I’m holding
Remaining memories close to me
And looks that warrant blasphemy
And times that most poor souls won’t see
[Chorus]
But in the night I develop your legs
Onto the negatives in my head
But I’ll keep them crossed let’s not pretend all hope is not lost
And that we aren’t the living dead
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass to my head
[Verse 2]
What was it that Jesus said? Was it bread or wine first I forget
'Cause I left god in the cradle
I wish I hadn’t gone and drank my rеnt 'cause it did nothing for my head
I’d love to look up and feel stablе
[Chorus]
But in the night you burn in my head
Like a stubbed out cigarette
Your ever-pirouetting silhouette against my doorstep
Follows, follows me to bed
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass to my head
[Vocalizing]
[Bridge]
What’s a man supposed to be when his lust turns to frozen peas
With no hot drop left in his head
I’ll come to lie with your new life and redefine my finish line
And leave your love sit on your fence
[Chorus]
But in the night I develop your legs
Onto the negatives in my head
But I’ll keep them crossed let’s not pretend all hope is not lost
And that we aren’t the living dead
To my sun dance kid, you are
Sugar glass

Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come and you call to me by name
But still you come and you call to me by name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love and you don't forget my name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

Get it together
That's what I say to me
I put on the pressure
You could do better
Be who you're supposed to be
But that's when you came in
Right when I needed you
Said all of the things that I was believing
Not one of them were true
[Pre-Chorus]
You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now
[Chorus]
'Cause you stood right there
And then you broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through your eyes (saw me)
I saw me through your eyes (saw me)
I saw me through your eyes

I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

And carry it into the light

I lived my life to the limit
Where I met the end of myself
I see the edge but I know below me

I've got nothing to lose
So I can't stop, won't stop falling into You

As I lost control of my life

You know how I do it, I ain't playin' with you, I've been grindin' Anybody tryna sleep on me better do somethin' with your eyelids
I hear a lot of whinin', but I don’t hear a lot of rhymin', woo!
Everybody got opinions, let it go into my ear and then I block that
Put me on stage, I'ma rock that
Sayin' you the best? Stop that
Phony, I am not that, yeah
What are y'all doin' out here? What are y'all doin' out here?
Maybe you should spend a little less time with the women in your arms and a little bit more with your career
I ain't saying I'm the best, but I should be in the top ten; give me a list of names, I'ma top them
I'm just playing with ya, I don't care where the top is
Leave me at the bottom, let me work for it
You ain't never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
Tell me that he works more, nah!
You might see me with my hoodie up, I ain't leaving 'til I finish
This industry ain't nothing but a box, but I ain't gon' climb in it
You put me inside a room full of rappers, come back in five minutes
I'ma be the only one still alive, with a note on my chest saying that I did it!
You do it for fame, we are way different
Y'all are looking weak, we ain't cooking in the same kitchen
Everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
Some of us'll never wear it out though, lemme get it!
I guess I don't understand
This wasn't part of my plan
Some of these people, they're thinking 'cause they heard the name that they really know who I am
Bring the beat down!
I got no time for these Hollywood people, I'd rather give time to my fans
You'd rather chill with these women that like you for money
But I'd rather chill with my fam, yeah
I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here grindin'
Yeah, I see the mic but you looking like a pilot
What's the point of a plane if you don't know how to fly it?

Rise of the underdog, I don't like none of y'all
I'm not like one of y'all
I'm from the jungle, I run with the son of God
Yeah, what is you running for?
They should be running from me
Most of my family, we don't even speak
I'm getting married in 22 weeks
And they still haven't said "Hi" or wanted to meet, huh?
I'm not the type to complain
If we don't get it, we try it again
And I'd die for the gang, Misfit my blood
They don't like us and we question they mom like
"Why did—why did you allow your kid to like bad music?"
Woo! Promise I do it (woo!)
I'm tryna give you my everything
I don't care what they are doing
I'm tryna do what they couldn't do
Laugh at the rappers you look up to
Don't waste time with the centerfolds (ay!)
I'm alive, it's a miracle (ooh)
Freestylin' since middle school (woo!)
I will battle the principal (woo!)
Wear all black like a funeral

Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, never fell in love with the coco, never had to hold up the store with a .44
Never had the door kicked in by the feds while I'm laying in the bed on the bread that I'm gon' blow (woop!), uh
But I do know what it feel like to go to school with the knock off shoes
Eating free lunch trying to act all cool
Boy, you better know that we paid our dues
Never would I trade that (no!), 'cause it made me better
Could've made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure
But it made me richer
Yeah, being broke made me rich
And being low made you quit
But being low made me high
Take time if you want this, let's go!
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by

Being broke made me rich, yeah

Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Money may have made me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use your muscle, learn to grind, and keep your mind up on the future, man
We came out them trenches
Government assistance in the beginning
Keep them cans for the pennies
We saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wondering what I got, and wondering how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty-handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay the lawyer fee, but it's all good, the squad pitching in
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah

Girl: Who's the song about, Gazelle?
Aha: Oh my goodness, why you worried...
Girl: Watchu' mean why I'm worried about it?
Aha: Look, The song - The song's about you, it's about you...
Girl: No, why am I worried about it?
Aha: The song about's you!
Girl: It's not about me! If you would just tell me the truth, all of this could be aborted...
Aha: Why does it matter?
Girl: Watchu' mean why does it matter? You know what, I'm sick of all these love songs, I watch you better when you rap...
[Verse 1]
This ain't for my fans, this for all my air conditioners
Campaign so strong, I could run for senator
Lion looking riding for something that he can't provide
Tryna kill me cause I got these powers
, I just seen a Sentinel
You'll never find identical, quit trying to compare me
Ain't doing drugs but man Aha got 'em like "how dare he?"
I understand that y'all pretending's just a means to an end
But I'm a comic geek so grown men in masks don't scare me
Lately, all these labels got me laughing, and nothing's funny
I'm tryin to hide my temper tantrum
Like you don't even have a hostage
How you ask for ransom
Call Silentó if you tryna to learn some new dances
And in addition, gettin' money so it shouldn't matter
Do whatever you have to do to make your pockets fatter
Mr. Krabs will have you slaving making Krabby Patties
I guess that we become stars and get as dumb as Patrick
My friend told me that I'm changing acting out of character
I said "Funny choice of words" cause I'm no longer acting
I walk around like I got rings around me like Saturn
Forcefield to keep away all you shenanigans
All my new stuff, I really rep Louisiana
And people who ain't from the South make and start laughing
And think that it's an insult when they call us ratchet
Hold on...hold on...hold on...
[Refrain]
They telling me that you can't have it all, you have to share the wealth
We gon' play keep away if you try to keep it for yourself
When the little man cuts out the middle, man, they put an X on Malcolm's hands so they can go and put an album on the shelf
The only problem is that if I leave then there is no one else
They tried to clone me like "Really, boy, you thought we couldn't tell?"
I lift my eyes up to the hills and then I ask God for help
And then I ask Him for forgiveness when they ask "how much for sale?"
"I need all of it, the home budget, the big numbers..."
The way we ball make 'em pause when they stop and
See them big commas, we walk around like emperors
If we ain't the GOATS then we some talking llamas with a new groove
All the money and all the clothes, the whole buffet and extra butter on the dinner roll still wouldn't be enough
[Verse 2]
Believe in God, you don't have to believe in us
They colour blind, so they ain't seeing us
And if they say they can, they lying
When they find out you can read, I guarantee they ain't buying
Wasn't gonna say a word, but I can't keep quiet
Just wanna make their pockets fatter like [?]
I'm optimistic but it doesn't mean I can't keep trying
I'm talking to myself like "Don't worry, it will be fine"
Should have a pro-bait the way these people all on my line
But I suggest you don't cross me that wouldn't be wise
Should go and pro skate the way I'm always on my grind
My bad, I apologise for that predictable line
I manoeuvre like a dope dealer, they want my supply
If you don't hear that "It's Aha" then the beat ain't mine ("IT'S AHA!")
Everyone up in my squad look like we commit crimes
You can charge me for arson 'cause I do spit fire
Born in '93 and ever since I've been that guy
Trying to buy a piece of land so I can be that squat
It bothers people when you do things without asking
All because it shows the fact you really don't need them
I'd rather be a gospel singer than a Christian rapper
'Cause Kirk Franklin got up on a Kanye feature
To tell the truth goin 'this hard ain't easy
To tell the truth the competition will prolly never beat me
Like how you beat the dude who's making all your beats and it gets worse because you can't beef because you hungry and you never bite the hand that feeds you
Y'all don't hear me, y'all just wanna look for any reason
I count my money in the back like I'm an old deacon
Turns out they feel played because all the songs the most plays
All got the AJ feature, oh Jesus
They like, "Aha, we want an interview..."
But that is on a list of things I ain't finna do
I rather be an Indian, Squanto, build me a casino
But we all know exactly what the pilgrims do
Like what you really wanna know about me that you can't just Google
They all ask the same question like "when you start doing music?"
Man, I'm TJ Henderson, smart guy with a smart mouth
The only time that I don't is when I just play stupid
They like, "I know you new to CHH but you may be the best"
And my only reply was "What was that?" I meant no disrespect
You can ask Ki'shon and Street, I never heard of it
I've only been making music, nothing more and nothing less
Basically I know who Lecrae was, and I respected his grind
He was the first rapper I recognized that was crossing the line
Up on BET showing that he wasn't ashamed of his faith
I felt I had no excuse to go and be ashamed of mine
I found out about Andy 'cause white people support they own skin
Rapping like a black guy, how could you not support him?
My homie CJ put me up on Social Club
And they were way too relatable
I always felt like a misfit
But other than that, there's Dre and 2 Chainz and J. Cole and K. Dot and Kanye and Kanye and KANYE
Big Sean, T. Scott, Future and Luther Vandross
He's the reason I've been singing, blame him for my bad notes
PJ Morton is one reason I start playing piano
Spent weekends hearing Weeknd hitting all them falsettos
Let the horns drop, I was raised in "Get Get Get It"
Listening to [?] low said he can rock it acapello
I was on to this one girl, she used to always ignore me
Now I'm the one ignoring her because I know she ain't for me
I remember we bumped T-Pain, I told her he's a legend, how he created a whole new sound but that's a whole 'nother story
But anyways why these strangers hit me up I just wonder
Plus the females, how they even go get my number?
They called my phone like "What's good, do you have time to talk?"
With no more excuses, I'mma start saying "No, I don't wanna"
They like I just hit you up because I'm trying to connect
Like I got WiFi for them to go get on internet
I say "I'll call you right back" and hopefully that's the end of that
I gotta hand it to 'em, they made sure I wouldn't feel that
They like "Let's build something bro" then they get real specific
And at this point I just hang up before they bring up logistics
Man my house has been built
I only got room for my family and friends
No room for guests, so you can't live up in it
And all these label guys tryna chop the number up like Samurais
Way more than [?], they gon' have you skinned alive
Feel so disrespected, I should get the double barrel
Tryna walk the straight and narrow but have you ever had some curly fries
Y'all act like y'all new to this, making me put up with foolishness
I sat up in the meeting, y'all didn't even know who Boosie is
Y'all didn't do your research
Y'all don't know how much I'm worth
They can't be hard, I made sure you can google this
Y'all hooligans
They tryna read my face like i don't know what mood he's in
I dropped Vegeta and did what they said I wouldn't do again
They thought the sauce was a fluke
That song had been broke the roof
A year later and they still jammin because it sounds brand new
I never tried to hide God, the whole time I stayed true
It ain't no secret, what he's done for others, he'll do for you
[?]
[Refrain]
They telling me that you can't have it all, you have to share the wealth
We gon' play keep away if you try to keep it for yourself
When the little man cuts out the middle, man, they put an X on Malcolm's hands so they can go and put an album on the shelf
The only problem is that if I leave then there is no one else
They tried to clone me like "Really, boy, you thought we couldn't tell?"
I lift my eyes up to the hills and then I ask God for help
And then I ask Him for forgiveness when they ask "how much for sale?"
"I need all of it, the home budget, the big numbers..."
The way we ball make 'em pause when they stop and
See them big commas, we walk around like emperors
If we ain't the GOATS then we some talking llamas with a new groove
All the money and all the clothes, the whole buffet and extra butter on the dinner roll still wouldn't be enough

I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing

Keep humming when the song's through?
It's like
They're living life to a whole different tune
And have you ever met those that
Keep hoping when it's hopeless

God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I
So will I

If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart eight billion different ways
Every precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

I've been held by the Savior
I've felt fire from above
I've been down to the river
I ain't the same, a prodigal returned
[Chorus: Crowder]
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God that yesterday's gone
All my sins are forgiven
I've been washed by the blood
[Verse 2: Tauren Wells]
I'm no stranger to the prison
I've worn shackles and chains
But I've been freed and forgiven (yes I have)
I'm not going back
I'll never be the same
That's why I sing...
[Chorus: Crowder & Tauren Wells]
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God that yesterday's gone
All my sins are forgiven
I've been washed by the blood
[Bridge: Crowder]
There's a kind of thing that just breaks a man
Break him down to his knees
God, I've been broken more than a time or two (yes, Lord)
Then He picked me up and showed me
What it means to be a man
Come on and sing...
[Chorus: Crowder & Tauren Wells]
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God that yesterday's gone
Yes, all my sins are forgiven
I've been washed by the blood
Come on and sing
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God that yesterday's gone
Yes, all my sins are forgiven
Oh, I've, I've been washed by the blood

Though at times it seems like I'm coming undone
This walk can often feel lonely
No matter what until this race is won
I will stand my ground where hope can be found
I will stand my ground where hope can be found
[Chorus]
Oh!
O'Lord, O'Lord I know You hear my cry
Your love is lifting me above all the lies
No matter what I face this I know in time
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right
[Verse 2]
Your strength is found at the end of my rope
Your grace it reaches to the hurting
Still through the tears and the questioning why
I will stand my ground where hope can be found
I will stand my ground where hope can be found
[Chorus]
Oh!
O'Lord, O'Lord I know You hear my cry
Your love is lifting me above all the lies

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Had as much of you as I can take
I'm so done, so over being afraid
[Verse 1]
I've gone through the motions
I've been back and forth
I know that you're thinking you've heard this before
I don't know how to say it
So I'm just gonna say it, yeah
[Chorus]
Fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
[Verse 2]
Take a minute, let it settle in
You probably never saw it coming
Something's gotta give so I give up you, oh
There's no room for you here
Yeah, I've had enough
The no vacancy sign on my heart is lit up
In case you didn't hear it
Here it is again
[Chorus]
Oh, fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
[Bridge]
Is there anybody out there just like me?
(Anybody out there?)
Anybody needing fear to leave? (Ooo yeah)
If you don't know how to say it
Sing along with me
[Chorus]
Sing fear, you don't own me
There ain't no room in this story
And I ain't got time for you
Telling me what I'm not
Like you know me, well guess what?
I know who I am
I know I'm strong, brave
And I am free
Got my own identity
So fear, you will never be welcome here
Woah, goodbye, goodbye fear, woah
You will never be welcome here

You see right through the mess inside me
And you call me out to pull me in
You tell me I can start again
And I don't need to keep on hiding

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown
[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(I keep my head above water, above water)
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
[Bridge]
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep
[Chorus]
So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
[Outro]
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water

A lot of us grew up believing
At any moment we could lose it all
And at the drop of a hat
God might turn His back and move on
A lot of us feel like we blew it
Thinking that we're just too far gone
But I want you to know
There's still a hope for you now
[Chorus]
No matter what you've done
You can't erase His love
Nothing can change it
You're not separated
No matter what

There's never been a better time to get clean
So come as you are
Run to the cross and be free
Oh, be free

You can't erase His love
Nothing can change it
You're not separated

And found the God, with healing in His hands
I turned to You, put everything behind me
And found the God, who makes all things new
I look to You, drowning in my questions
And found the God, who holds all wisdom
And I trusted You, and stepped out on the ocean
You caught my hand among the waves

I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows
And found the God, who relentlessly pursues
I hid from You, haunted by my failures
And found the God, whose grace still covers me

And found the God, the lifter of my head
And I've worshipped You, and felt You right beside me
You're the reason that I sing

As one before the King
'Cause we believe

All the world starts changing
When the church starts praying
Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray
Prison walls start shaking
At the sound of praising
Nothing stays the same
Oh, when we pray
Oh, when we pray, oh

I see revival rising
I see hope on the horizon
As a generation stepping out in faith

Because we will be a people on our knees
As one before the King
'Cause we believe

All the world starts changing

Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray

Let Your will be done

Strongholds start to break
Oh, when we pray

Strongholds start to break

I don't wanna see anymore, give me a vision
That you could move this heart, to be set apart

How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Verse 2]
Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name

On the nights when the dark last a little bit longer
When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
When the fear in my heart dips a little bit deeper
When my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker
[Pre-Chorus]
Where could I run to?
Where could I go?
[Chorus]
Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take
I know
You never let me go
And even when the waters won't stop rising
Even when I'm caught in the dead of a night
I know
No matter how it ends
You're with me even then
[Verse 2]
When the days up ahead look a little bit brighter
But the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter
I'm reminded Your grace never asks for perfection
Oh I'm restored 'cause I'm Yours and I stand forgiven

Even when it feels like my world is shaken
Even when I've had all that I can take

You alone are my defense when
I'm standing on Your promises

My feet are frozen on this middle ground
The water's warm here but the fire's gone out
I played it safe for so long the passion left
Turns out safe is just another word for regret
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
We're all dying to live but we're all scared to death
And this is the part where my head tells my heart
You should turn back around but there's no turning back now
[Chorus]
I'm going all in
Headfirst into the deep end
I hear You calling
And this time the fear won't win
I'm going, I'm going all in

Sometimes you lose some

I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't

When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well, good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may

Save through the fire with Your mighty hand

The outside looking in
This is where grace begins
We were hungry, we were thirsty
With nothing left to give
Oh the shape that we were in
Just when all hope seemed lost
Love opened the door for us
He said come to the table
Come join the sinners who have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free
Come to the table
Come meet this motley crew of misfits
These liars and these thieves
There's no one unwelcome here
So that sin and shame that you brought with you
You can leave it at the door
Let mercy draw you near
Come to the table
Come join the sinners who have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free
Come to the table
Come to the table
To the thief and to the doubter
To the hero and the coward
To the prisoner and the soldier
To the young and to the older
All who hunger, all who thirst
All the last and all the first
All the paupers and the princes
All who fail you've been forgiven
All who dream and all who suffer
All who loved and lost another
All the chained and all the free
All who follow, all who lead
Anyone who's been let down
All the lost you have been found
All who have been labeled right or wrong
To everyone who hears this song
Ooh
Come to the table
Come join the sinners you have been redeemed
Take your place beside the Savior
Sit down and be set free
Oooh
Sit down and be set free
Come to the table
Come to the table
Just sit down and rest a while
Just sit down and rest a while
Come to the table

God of creation
There at the start, before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
[Chorus 1]
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I
So will I
[Verse 2]
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
[Chorus 2]
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I, so will I
[Bridge]
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!
Whoa!
[Verse 3]
God of salvation
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The Light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
[Chorus 3]
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
[Outro]
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire?
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

Make it count, leave a mark, build a name for yourself
Dream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else
Make a name the world remembers
But all an empty world can sell is empty dreams
I got lost in the lie that it was up to me
To make a name the world remembers
But Jesus is the only name to remember
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Verse 2]
All the kingdoms built, all the trophies won
Will crumble into dust when it's said and done
'Cause all that really matters
Did I live the truth to the ones I love?
Was my life the proof that there is only One
Whose name will last forever?
[Chorus]
And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live
I'll let every second point to Him
Only Jesus
[Interlude]

Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember, ooh
Jesus is the only name, Jesus is the only name
Jesus is the only name to remember

And I-I-I, I don't want to leave a legacy
I don't care if they remember me
Only Jesus
And I-I-I, I've only got one life to live

If grace was a kingdom, I stopped at the gate
Thinking I don’t deserve to pass through after all the mistakes that I’ve made
Oh, but I heard a whisper as Heaven bent down
Said, “Child, don’t you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown”
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
[Verse 2]
The pages of history they tell me it’s true
That it’s never the perfect; it’s always the ones with the scars that You use
Oh, it’s the rebels and the prodigals; it’s the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose, tell me there’s hope for sinners like me
[Chrous]
Now I’m just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours
I'm all Yours
[Outro]
Grace is a kingdom with gates open wide
There’s a seat at the table just waiting for you
So, come on inside

I've been taught how to talk to You
Hold it together
Make the bad look better
Say all the words that I'm supposed to
Bow my head, say, "Amen"
Yeah, that'll do
Making every dead-end look like heaven
Like being okay is the way to reach You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But You're not afraid of all the things I feel
So why am I afraid of being real?
[Chorus 1]
You want my tears, every messy word
Every scar and every fear
You want all I have
With no holding back
When I'm hurt, at my worst
You meet me there
'Cause You see the beauty
In my broken prayers!
In my broken prayers!
[Verse 2]
You don't care if it ain't poetry
'Cause all of my edges
They are a little rough
But that's all I got to bring

Don't have to hide the scars that still aren't healed

Desperate cry in a dark place

It's a momma singing songs about the Lord
It's a daddy spending family time that the world said he cannot afford
These simple moments change the world
It's a pastor at a tiny little Church
Forty years of loving for the broken and the hurt
These simple moments change the world
[Chorus]
Dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
Dream small
[Verse 2]
It's visiting the widow down the street
Or dancing on a Friday with your friend with special needs
These simple moments change the world
Of course there's nothing wrong with bigger dreams
Just don't miss the minutes on your way, your bigger things
'Cause these simple moments change the world
[Chorus]
But dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
So dream small

Keep loving, keep serving
Keep listening, keep learning
Keep praying, keep hoping
Keep seeking, keep searching
Out of these small things and watch them grow bigger
The God who does all things makes oceans… from river

But dream small
Don't buy the lie you've gotta do it all
Just let Jesus use you where you are
One day at a time
Live well
Loving God and others as yourself
Find little ways where only you can help
With His great love
A tiny rock can make a giant fall
Yeah, 
five loaves and two fish's could feed them all
So dream small

Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin
Lost without hope with no place to begin
Your love made a way to let mercy come in
When death was arrested and my life began

Ash was redeemed only beauty remains
My orphan heart was given a name
My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance
When death was arrested and my life began

It's Your endless love, pouring down on us
You have made us new, now life begins with You

Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more
My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore
He cancelled my debt and He called me His friend

Have you stopped reaching no longer seeking greater things?
Have you forgotten you have a Father listening?
He tells the sun when to rise, gives the wind its breath
Swings a door wide open and moves in the moment you least expect

Don't you give up on a miracle
You’ve got to speak to the impossible
You gotta pray till your breakthrough breaks through the ceiling, keep on believing
Don't you give up, don't you give up on a miracle

You are not hidden
There’s never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen

I hear your SOS, your SOS

I will send out an army
To find you in the middle of darkest night
It’s true
I will rescue you

That cannot be covered
Over and over
You’re not defenseless
I’ll be your shelter
I’ll be your armor

What is this love that won't relent
That's calling out with heaven's breath

That we could never recompense
Who gives us all a second chance?

And showed the sun how bright to shine
Who shaped the world within His hands?

Only You, only You, only You

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clingin' to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waitin' for 'em to attack
They say "Don't get bitter, get better."
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm goin' through
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They say fear haunts and pain hates
I say pain strengthens and fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
And hopin' that I'll put together somethin' right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trustin' in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
No don't let the fear make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I – I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no

Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you

Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am

Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
Oh, I may have took some time
But now I realize
My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
There's not a hole too deep
That God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!
[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
Can you hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

[Verse 1]
I’ve got things that I thought
Would fill my heart up, sittin’ on top winning
But that ain’t winning
I’ve chased all the good stuff, all the bad stuff
Stuff the world calls living
But that ain’t living
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hey-hey-hey-ey
Don't really matter what I do
Hey-hey-hey-ey
Don't mean nothin’ without You
[Chorus]
I don’t wanna have it all
Write my story any way I want
Everything will just fall apart
If You ain’t in it 
(if You ain't in it)
I don’t wanna get my way
No, I don’t wanna run this thing
'Cause I know it all ends the same
If You ain’t in it

Here is my confession
I’m a man of imperfection
And my heart can go off chasin’ empty things
But You keep runnin’ toward me
Yeah 'cause You know what’s best for me
And You know You are the only one I need
Oh I don’t wanna have it, all
I don’t wanna have it, all
If You ain’t in it

I searched through the Earth for something that could satisfy
A peace for the hurt I had buried deep inside
Knees on the floor, I finally found everything I needed
You lifted my soul and opened up my eyes
[Chorus]
I never knew anything lasts forever
Till I found You, till I found You
I never dreamed anything could be better
Till I found You, till I found You

Oh, I never knew anything lasts forever

Oh, knees on the floor
I finally found that everything I needed was always right in front of me
You gave me a name and you changed everything I am

Word of life
Speak to my weary heart
Strengthen my broken parts
Lead me to Your open arms
Word of truth
Illuminate all these lies
The enemy speaks inside
In freedom I will rise
[Chorus]

So I can live like I’ve been changed
There is a new song in my soul
And it begins when I breathe in
Your word of life

Spirit of God
Take me to a deeper place
Take me out of what is safe
I will not be afraid
Spirit of God
Fill me with joy again
Springing up from within
It cannot be contained

Every time you've fallen down
When you're hurting, feeling shame
When you're numbing all your pain
When you've lost your way
And feel so far away
You're not

You're beautifully broken
And You can be whole again
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
Beautifully broken

For who you are no matter what
When you're stumbling, with each step
And you're haunted by regret
And the darkness closes in
Just listen

Even when my light burns low
I can never lose my hope
I've been down this road before
Now I know which way to go
You can try to drag me down
But I'll be living in the clouds
Everybody has their doubts but you can't stop now
[Chorus: Jordan Feliz]
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta live
You just, you just gotta
[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Yeah, I want it like I need to breathe
Yeah, make it clear like I need to see (Woo)
As a kid, mama told me sky's the limit
'Til you hit it like Ken Griffey to the fences
Out the park, hit and run, that's my drive (That's my drive)
It's a vibe, been that way all my life, yeah
I shut it down, when I shine with the crew
Yeah, I ride with the crew
Gave my life to the truth, testify
Walk on water like the Son of man
Understand I'll never drown (Splash)
Take a hit and never quit (Woo)
Might be down but never out
There are days that I fail (Fail)
And the trains off the rail (Rail)
Through the pain we prevail (Pow)
Tell 'em you just gotta live

Keep on living 'til there's nothing left
Lean on we just like there's no one else
Ain't nobody out here more like You
And with You they broke mold
Ain't no more like You that for sure
I can't drop out like the top down on the coupe
Tell 'em watch out when I walk out, make 'em move
Sunday morning with my hands up (Hands up)
Like they got the handcuffs (Handcuffs)
Searching for some answers
Since mama passed from cancer and my sister left Seattle with a one way ticket home
Hope she holding Chase and teaching him to speak Samoan
Gotta keep it going
Yeah, that's all they told me
Tell him you can make it when you know the one and only

Burning bright beyond the fire
You were born to win, yeah, you're a fighter
Don't let your light just fade away

So many hurting, so many lost
With all this striving, who can we lean on?
Creation's crying, out from the dark

The one solution, to every fear
I know my help and where it comes from

And in our weakness, He is strong
He holds the weight of, all of our failings
Great is our sin but greater the cross

And how many hours must we wait through to hear the truth

[Verse 1]
How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
[Chorus]
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
Oh, the life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
[Chorus]
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Interlude]

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper

Copy [Verse 1]
There is a wrestling in my heart and my mind
A disturbance and a tension I cannot seem to drive
And if I'm honest, there's quite a bit of fear
To sit here in this silence and really hear You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What will You ask of me?
Will I listen to Your voice when You speak?
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes things, they are black and white
Sometimes they are not and that leaves us torn inside
And in the middle, we are left to wonder
Who we are, what You want and where we're going
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh such a mystery
I don't always understand
But I believe!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
God help me
[Bridge]
I don't know the future, it's one day at a time
But I know I'll be okay with Your hand holding mine
So take all my resistance
Oh God I need Your grace
One step and then the other
Show me the way
Show me the way!
[Chorus]
Help me to move, help me to see
Help me to do whatever You would ask of me
Help me to go, God help me to stay
I'm feeling so alone here
And I know that You're faithful
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
But I can barely breathe
God help me

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I, I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
[Verse 2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved!
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first, oh, how I first believed
[Verse 3]
Now when we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun!
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun!

Oh, how I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now... I see!

This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah
[Verse 1: Marty]
I thought by now I would get it
His love for me is unmeasured
Still feel like I could do better
Was paralyzed by depression
But heaven and earth came together
And You came to my rescue
I use my voice as a weapon
On earth like it's in heaven
Yeah, I never handle things too well
But I was made to fly, not to fail
I don't need man's approval
When God sent me to bring heaven
Down for the kids going through hell
Yeah, we gon' make it
I don't care what the world's been saying
It's time to step up, not cave in
The grace He gave us, amazing
A love that could conquer the hatred
But it's up to us
A new generation to show His love
From the ends of the earth to the day He comes
[Chorus: Tauren Wells]
This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah
This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah
[Verse 2: Fern]
Okay, we turned the stage to an altar at the last show
Something about when you know you’re being impactful
Using the tools I was given but being tactful
Went from the pit to raps inside of a mac full
With the power size of a Mack truck
I went through the hard times, no bad luck
Graduated cap, gown with the tassle
Now I make art like Basel
But I still keep it classic like a left eye rhyme
Big Poppa like the Bed Stuy guy
I got the dirt off my shoulders like Jay in his prime
I stood on my own two like the veterans taught
If I ever lay down, let it be for some rest
And whenever I'm recharged, let me be at my best
So whenever I’m pouring out all your love to the rest
Now you can go and tell them the rest
[Chorus: Tauren Wells]
This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah
This is our war cry, we'll rise up
And this is our time to rise up, rise up, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Copy For so long I carried the weight of my past
Cripple by burdens like stones on my back
I thought I had fallen too far from your grace
But you came and showed me the way
When I was lost soul searching
You were the ground beneath my feet
When I was blind man begging
You were the eyes so I could see
When the smoke was rising up
You were the air that I could breath
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Now all I can see are the fields of your grace
Wherever I run your leading the way
You shook the shackles off my feet
I found redemption on my knees
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Oh I'm a survivor
You're my God
You're my fighter
You make me a survivor
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin

And pulled me out of the fire

I'm a survivor

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night
O night divine
[Verse 2]
Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name

Ain't nobody gonna change the standard
It's not enough to just feel the flame
You've gotta burn your old self away
[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
[Verse 3]
You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It take some time to make your courage strong
[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
[Bridge]
When the wolves come and hunt me down
I will face them off and stand my ground
'Cause there's a fire burnin' in me
They will see my strength in this love I found
Oh
[Chorus]
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, 'cause it's a hard love

Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich, yeah
[Chorus: Perfekt]
Gotta keep the stove hot so it cook right
If everybody eating that's a good night
Had to take a loss 'fore I took flight
Hard times made for a good life
I said being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, never fell in love with the coco, never had to hold up the store with a .44
Never had the door kicked in by the feds while I'm laying in the bed on the bread that I'm gon' blow (woop!), uh
But I do know what it feel like to go to school with the knock off shoes
Eating free lunch trying to act all cool
Boy, you better know that we paid our dues
Never would I trade that (no!), 'cause it made me better
Could've made me bitter
Can't buy that struggle, can't name no figure
But it made me richer
Yeah, being broke made me rich
And being low made you quit
But being low made me high
Take time if you want this, let's go!
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right

Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
Being broke made me rich
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Money may have made me richer, but the struggle got me richer than I ever been
Learn to hustle, use your muscle, learn to grind, and keep your mind up on the future, man
We came out them trenches
Government assistance in the beginning
Keep them cans for the pennies
We saving that grease after dinner
Now they counting all my pennies, counting all my figures, all up in my business, man
Now they watching what I'm spending, wondering what I got, and wondering how I get it, man
I was bought before I had a dollar, being empty-handed made me stupid rich
Rich in loyalty, can't pay the lawyer fee, but it's all good, the squad pitching in
[Pre-Chorus: Perfekt]
Being broke in this thing don't sit right
Do it for my folks, trying to get by
Came through the struggle with my head high
Been broke, then you know what it feel like

Hey, you
In the corner shaking in those boots
You got one, one for two
You got the shaking right, but the fear won't do
We always say that we have unspeakable joy
So let our feet do all the talking when our words fall short

We've got reason to get up
Reason to get down
He done traded our sin for joy
And now, that joy wants out

Hey, yeah you
In the back of the room with those concrete shoes
It's okay, to cut loose
Oh, it ain't about how you move, but what moves you
We're so consumed with what we think we're supposed to be
That we stop living like we know that we're free

I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity
[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours

What You say of me

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

Wide awake while the world is sound asleepin'
Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreamin'
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you
Every day you try to pick up all the pieces
All the memories, they somehow never leave you
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you
[Chorus]
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that

So afraid if someone saw them, they would leave
But somebody, somebody, somebody sees you
Somebody, somebody will never leave you

Hmm
[Verse 1]
Have you been praying and you still have no answers?
Have you been pouring out your heart for so many years?
Have you been hoping that things would have changed by now?
Have you cried all the faith you have through so many tears?
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget the things that He has done before
And remember He can do it all once more
[Chorus]
It's like the brightest sunrise
Waiting on the other side of the darkest night
Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
You're closer than you think you are
Only moments from the break of dawn
All His promises are just up ahead
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet (Oh)
Maybe you just haven't seen it
[Verse 2]
He had the solution before you had the problem
He sees the best in you when you feel at your worst
So in the questioning, don't ever doubt His love for you
'Cause it's only in His love that you'll find a breakthrough, oh

Good things are coming even when we can't see

Good things are coming even when we can't see
We can't see it yet, but we believe that

Dream your dreams, chase your heart, above all else
Make a name the world remembers

To make a name the world remembers
But Jesus is the only name to remember

Was my life the proof that there is only One
Whose name will last forever?

If I didn't know what it hurt like to be broken
Then how would I know what it feels like to be whole
If I didn't know what it cuts  like to be rejected
Then I wouldn't know the joy of coming home
[Chorus]
Maybe it's ok if I'm not ok
'Cause the One who holds the world is holding on to me
Maybe it's all right if I'm not all right
'Cause the One who holds the stars is holding my whole life
[Verse 2]
If I didn't know what it looked like to be dirty
Then I wouldn't know what it feels like to be clean
And if all of my shame hadn't drove me to hide in the shadows
Then I wouldn't know the beauty of being free
[Chorus]
Maybe it's ok if I'm not ok
'Cause the One who holds the world is holding on to me
Maybe it's all right if I'm not all right
'Cause the One who holds the stars is holding my whole life
[Bridge]
Father, let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done
Here, in my heart as in Heaven
Father, let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done
Here, in my heart as in Heaven, oh!
[Chorus]
Maybe it's ok if I'm not ok
'Cause the One who holds the world is holding on to me
Maybe it's all right if I'm not all right
'Cause the One who holds the stars is holding my whole life
[Outro]
Now I'm alive in You
We're bursting at the seams
Now I'm alive and I see You in everything
Maybe it's ok if I'm not ok

I count on one thing
The same God that never fails
Will not fail me now
You won't fail me now
In the waiting
The same God who's never late
Is working all things out
You're working all things out

Yes I will, lift You high in the lowest valley
Yes I will, bless Your name
Oh, yes I will, sing for joy when my heart is heavy
All my days, oh, yes I will

Some say, "Don't give up,"
And hope that your good is good enough
Head down, keep on working
If you could earn it, you deserve it
Some say, "Push on through"
After all it's the least that you can do
But don't buy what they're selling
It couldn't be further from the truth
[Chorus]
What if I were the one to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the one to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's not good news
It's the best news ever
[Verse 2]
Some say, "Don't ask for help"
God helps the ones who help themselves
Press on get it right
Otherwise get left behind
Some say, "He's keeping score"
So try hard then try a little more
But hold up, if this were true
Explain to me what the cross is for
[Chorus]
What if I were the one to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the one to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's not good news
It's the best news ever
Best news ever

So won't you, come!
Come all you weary and you burdened
You heavy laden and you hurting
For all of you with nothing left
Come and find rest!
[Chorus]
What if I were the one to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the one to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's not good news
It's the best news ever!
Best news ever...

It's so unusual it's frightening
You see right through the mess inside me
And you call me out to pull me in
You tell me I can start again
And I don't need to keep on hiding
[Chorus]
I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do
And it's not one or the other
It's hard truth and ridiculous grace
To be known fully known and loved by You
I'm fully known and loved by You

It's so like You to keep pursuing
It's so like me to go astray
But You guard my heart with Your truth
A kind of love that's bullet proof
And I surrender to Your kindness

I'm fully known and loved by You
You won't let go no matter what I do

How real, how wide
How rich, how high is Your heart
I cannot find the reasons why
You give me so much

Freedom was something I never found
Trying to find 
six feet underground
Under the weight of all of my sin
Fighting the fight that I couldn't win
[Pre-Chorus]
Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe
[Chorus]
I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
Until I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life
[Verse 2]
I look for the words but cannot explain
A new kind of love ran into my veins
You are the key to all of my chains
To all that I was, now I'm not a slave

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
 
(
Father, I stretch
)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard
[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar

I can't seem to keep it all together

Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder

And you’d give anything you think to feel the sun
Always reaching, always climbing
Always second guessing the timing
But God has a plan, a purpose in this
You are His child and don't you forget

He put that fire in your soul
His love is the reason (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooooh)

I went searching for redemption down the road that had no end
I was walking through this fire, I was living on the run
With my flesh lost in desire, I was drowning in the flood

Rich in mercy
You came to save me
Now I'm alive

Strong and mighty
You reached down for me
So I could rise

I am far from being perfect, there are days that I regret
On this battlefield, I struggle with the lies that I have lived
I have fallen short of glory, I can't make it on my own
If You kept record of my past, I'd been sinking like a stone

There I was on death row
Guilty in the first degree
Son of God hanging on a hill
Hell was my destiny

Could've come from these lips of mine
The dirty shame was killing me
It would take a miracle to wash me clean

And the ground began to shake
The prison walls started falling
And I became a free man that day

Breath of God filled my lungs
And the Holy Ghost awakened me
Yeah, the Holy Ghost awakened me
[Chorus]
When I read the red letters
And the ground began to shake
The prison walls started falling
And I became a free man that day
[Bridge]
For God so loved the whole wide world
Sent His only Son to die for me
Arms spread wide for the whole wide world
His arms spread wide where mine should be
Jesus changed my destiny
[Chorus]
Thank You, God, for red letters
When the ground began to shake
The grace of God started falling
And I became a free man that day
The prison walls started falling
And I am a free man… today

Copy [Verse 1]
There was a time that I swore I would never go back
I was blind to the truth, didn't know what I had
I was running, I was searching
But every place I turned for healing
Left me more broken than the last
[Chorus]
Take me back
To the place that feels like home
To the people I can depend on
To the faith that's in my bones
Take me back
To a preacher and a verse
Where they've seen me at my worst
To the love I had at first
Oh, I want to go to church
[Verse 2]
Tried to walk on my own but I wound up lost
Now I'm making my way to the foot of the cross
It's not a trophy for the winners
It's a shelter for the sinners
And it's right where I belong
[Chorus]
Take me back
To the place that feels like home
To the people I can depend on
To the faith that's in my bones
Take me back
To a preacher and a verse
Where they've seen me at my worst
To the love I had at first
Oh, I want to go to church
I want to go to church
[Bridge]
Oh, more than an obligation
It's our foundation
The family of God
I know it's hard
But we need each other
We're sisters and brothers
[Chorus]
Oh, take me back
To the place that feels like home
To the people I can depend on
To the faith that's in my bones
Take me back
To a preacher and a verse
Where they've seen me at my worst
To the love I had at first
Oh, I want to go to church
Yeah, I want to go to church (Take me back)
Oh, I want to go, want to go, I want to go
Oh, I want to go to church (Take me back)
Oh, I want to go to church

I searched through the Earth for something that could satisfy
A peace for the hurt I had buried deep inside
Knees on the floor, I finally found everything I needed
You lifted my soul and opened up my eyes
[Chorus]
I never knew anything lasts forever
Till I found You, till I found You
I never dreamed anything could be better

You gave me a name and you changed everything I am

There I was empty-handed
Crying out from the pit of my despair
There You were in the shadows
Holding out Your hand You met me there
[Pre-Chorus]
And now where would I be without You?
Where would I be, Jesus?
[Chorus]
You were the voice in the desert
Calling me out in the dead of night
Fighting my battles for me
You are my rescue story
Lifted me up from the ashes
Carried my soul from death to life
Bringing me from glory to glory
You are my rescue story

You are, You are
You are my rescue story

Before I had a name
Before I needed grace, oh
Singing songs of redemption
'Cause every time I ran away
You were louder than my shame

And now where would I be without You?
Where would I be, Jesus?

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa’s on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I’m offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

On the nights when the dark last a little bit longer
When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
When the fear in my heart dips a little bit deeper
When my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker

Where could I run to?
Where could I go?

No matter how it ends

Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A

Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'

I got my weapons in the spirit's land

Hallelujah, He is wonderful
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up
 (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth
[Outro: Kanye West]
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo

Copy For so long I carried the weight of my past
Cripple by burdens like stones on my back
I thought I had fallen too far from your grace
But you came and showed me the way
When I was lost soul searching
You were the ground beneath my feet
When I was blind man begging
You were the eyes so I could see
When the smoke was rising up
You were the air that I could breath
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Now all I can see are the fields of your grace
Wherever I run your leading the way
You shook the shackles off my feet
I found redemption on my knees
You gave me hope you gave me something to believe
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Oh I'm a survivor
You're my God
You're my fighter
You make me a survivor
Now I'm alive and born again
Rescued from the grip of sin
God your love came crashing in
And pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor
Oh I'm a survivor
You pulled me out of the fire
I'm a survivor

Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre
[Verse]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

We're cast away on a lonely shore
I can see in your eyes, dear
It's hard to take for a moment more

It's hard for me to let go, hard for me to breathe
Thinking that I gotta control it all
I can feel my worry and anxiety
When it's slipping through my fingers and I know it
I've been losing my sleep, I've been losing my cool
I can feel my heart go boom, boom, boom
Starin' at the ceiling, feeling like a fool
I'm going under and I know it
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I hear You whisper to me
If I lose my grip I could see
That You are carrying me
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
Oh, 'cause if I trusted, I could move with Your flow
Being carried in the current of Your love
When I lean into Your arms, You're enough
So, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
[Verse 2]
Time for me to let go, time for me to breathe
Knowing that He already holds it all
Time for me to turn down this anxiety
I can know my freedom in a moment
'Cause when I lay it all down, You gonna lift me up
When I pour it all out You gonna fill my cup
You're holding out Your arms and telling me to jump
One, two, three, here I go, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I hear You whisper to me
If I lose my grip I would see
That You're always carrying me

Oh, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go
Oh, 'cause if I trusted, I could move with Your flow
Being carried in the current of Your love
When I lean into Your arms, You're enough
So, I'm gonna let it, I'm gonna let it go

Letting go of my worries (Letting go of my worries)
For my need to control things (For my need to control things)
I'm gonna take You at Your word and (I'm gonna take You at Your word)

Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
[Verse 2]
Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
[Chorus]
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
[Post-Chorus 1]
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
[Verse 3]
And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way
[Chorus]
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
[Post-Chorus 2]
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds me now
Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
‘Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand

About this joy I'm living in
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take the mic, go on and testify
How I was dead and then I came to life
No more living in the dark of night
Now everything's alright
[Chorus]
I've been changed, I've been saved
Brand new day
I've been changed, I've been changed

Future's bright and there ain't no doubt
I've been changed, I've been changed

God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is
[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

Copy [Verse 1]
There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
[Verse 2]
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way, I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body and now that power lives in me
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
[Bridge]
I can see the light in the darkness, as the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens, as the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us, as the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us, nothing stands between us
[Verse 3]
There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There'll be another in the fire, standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, how good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle, 'cause I know that's where You'll be
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
'Cause there is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I'm not a warrior, I'm too afraid to lose
I feel unqualified for what You're calling me to
But Lord with Your strength, I've got no excuse
'Cause broken people are exactly who You use
[Chorus]
So give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence
[Verse 2]
You took a shepherd boy and made him a King
So I'm gonna trust You and give You everything
I'll be a conqueror, 'cause You fight for me
I'll be a champion claiming Your victory
[Chorus]
So give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence
[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing and shout and shake the walls
I won't stop until I see them fall
I'm gonna stand up, step out when You call
Jesus, Jesus
I'm gonna sing and shout and shake the walls
I won't stop until I see them fall
I'm gonna stand up, step out when You call
Jesus

Give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence, yeah!...

You come back with the head of my enemy
You come back and You call it my victory, oh-ooh

That You've even gone to win my war
Your love becomes my greatest defense
It leads me from the dry wilderness

All I did was bow down, oh
All I did was stay still

The other day, I was thinking to myself
Made a list of all my mistakes
Oh, I wish I could've run to you
And tell you all about my heartbreak
And I wondered to myself "Wait a minute
Am I even on the right path now?"
Had a couple wins, but I got knocked down
But I know if you were still around, you would say
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end
[Chorus]
You gotta get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Verse 2]
And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be
And even though in a moment
I know anything can change
You're perfect plans might fall apart
But the simple truth remains
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end
[Chorus]
You gotta get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Bridge]
'Cause you've only got one life
And you don't know when it ends
You've only got one heart
So get out there and live
Yeah, you've only got one life
Don't let it get away
Everyone falls down
But you can get up, up again
[Chorus]
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
[Outro]
And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be

Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up

Hands on, yeah, hands on
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God

If that's all the love you have, that's all you got
To sing of change

To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the 
King of Kings
[Verse 2]
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
[Verse 3]
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
[Verse 4]
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Praise forever to the King of Kings

I was down on my luck, I was stuck
I was running 'round broken-hearted
I was sinking so fast
I couldn't last falling apart

Leaving me there in my shame
Leaving me fighting my pain
But You made a better way

Goodbye to the sinner, I'm held by the Father above
No more shame

Ain't no grave got a hold on me
I'm born again, born again
Washed by the water, I'm clean

In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes

And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am

Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful

You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!
[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
Can you hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

More than anything that You can do

How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Verse 2]
Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name

Your buried body began to breathe

Declared the grave has no claim on me

I've been strong
And I’ve been broken within a moment
I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend
I’ve held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath
[Verse 2]
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
[Chorus]
And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me
[Verse 3]
Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious
And I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing
And still You want my heart
[Pre-Chorus 2]

Well I sweat in the heat of the battle
And I fought through the dust and the shadows
Oh, You never left my side
Never left my side, no
And I stood at the top of the world
I swam through the depths of my soul
No matter what I find
No matter what I find, oh

Drought or famine
High and low
[Chorus]
Wherever I go
Oh, You're gonna find me there
Wherever I go

Even in the pouring rain
Even in the flood, I'm safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You go wherever I go

You hold all the pieces together
You bring me strength in the desert
Oh, You defend my soul
You defend my soul
No height, no depth, no grave
Nothing on earth can keep you away
Oh, You're my only hope
You're my only hope

O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side
[Verse 2]
O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply
[Pre-Chorus 1]
In the highlands and the heartache
You’re neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find
[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
[Verse 3]
O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past
[Verse 4]
O how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side
[Pre-Chorus 2]
For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me
[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
[Bridge]
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent
My song of ascent
[Pre-Chorus 3]
From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave
[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

Why God
Do people have to die
A daughter or a son
Sudden and so young
Long before their time?
[Verse 2]
Why God
Do people fall apart
A promise and a ring
Becomes a broken thing
A road that got too hard?
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't understand
But I understand
[Chorus 1]
Why God I need You
It's why God I run to Your arms
Over and over again
It's why God I cling to Your love
And hold on for dear life
And I find You are right by my side

Why God
Do we feel so alone?
Every single day
Fighting through the pain
Hoping there is hope

Give me a faith stronger than I have
I need to know when it hurts this bad
That You hold my heart when it breaks
And I'm not alone in this place

That's why God I need You
Why God I run to Your arms
Over and over again
It's why God I cling to Your love
And hold on for dear life

Always right by my side
Even here in the why... God

Telling me it's ok, come just as you are
I never heard a melody, like the one that's singing over me
And I just wanna sing along, 'cause mercy is a song

Shining in the shadow of a stain glassed Sunday morning
Shouting hallelujah, yesterday is gone
Oh freedom is a choir and mercy is a song

No matter where you've been just come on home
Let all God's children sing along

Guilty is a lie, spoken by a thief
Saying after what you've done, you don't deserve to be free

Oh, Your love is better than life
You are the well that won't run dry
I have tasted and I have seen
You are better than all these things

Being liked and loved by everyone
Approval that outshines the sun
Cheered by all who think of me
You are better than all these things
You are better than all these things

You are better, oh, You're better
I have tasted and I have seen
You are better than all these things
Oh, Your love is better than life

Oh, I know You are better than all these things
I know You are better than all these things
I know You are better than all these things
You are better than I can imagine
Better than I can imagine, over, above what I seek
Better than I can imagine, Your love for me
Better than I can imagine, over, above what I seek in life
You are better than all these things
Woah, I know You are better than all these things

Beneath the surface
Of my anxious imagination
Beckons a calmness
That is found in You alone
It washes over
Every doubt, every imperfection
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul
[Chorus]
There's nowhere I’d rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I’m found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You
[Verse 2]
Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control
All my attention
On the wonder of this moment
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul

There's nowhere I'd rather be

So let all that I am
Be consumed with who You are
Oh, the glory of Your presence

What more could I ask for?
So let all that I am

I was lost in the light, I was blind but now I can see it
I was caught in the web of a lie that I was defeated
Well, it's hard for a heart to restart but I need to reset it
Not a way to erase what I've done but I need to forget it
[Pre-Chorus]
But the beautiful thing You're doing
Is making new things out of ruins
[Chorus]
All of the things I've been through
You put 'em in the rear view
Everything that You hold
You make it shine like gold
You hold the doors wide open
There's nothing Your love leaves broken
Everything that You hold
You make it shine like gold
[Verse 2]
There were times that I tried to get it right
But I couldn't understand it
Then I tripped and I fell on myself
You were right where I landed
You're the song that I've sung all along
And a mountain worth climbing
Looking out, even now
Not a doubt You're the rhythm inside me
[Chorus]
All of the things I've been through
You put 'em in the rear view
Everything that You hold
You make it shine like gold
You hold the doors wide open
There's nothing Your love leaves broken
Everything that you hold
You make it shine like gold
You make it shine like gold

I wasn't created to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

You saw my condition, had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart
And I don't have a context for that kind of love
I don't understand, I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You

I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait

Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike

Stretch my hands to You

Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
 
(
Stretch my hands to You
)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal

Father, I stretch

Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life

Stretch my hands to You

Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your

I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad

Stretch my hands to You

Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

Are you disappointed? Are you desperate for help?
You know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself
Well, you start to believe you don't have what it takes
'Cause it's all you can do just to move much less finish the race
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget what lies ahead
[Chorus]
Almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home
[Verse 2]
Well, this road will be hard, but we win in the end
Simply because of Jesus in us, it's not if, but when
So take joy in the journey, even when it feels long
Oh, find strength in each step knowing Heaven is cheering you on
[Chorus]
We are almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home
[Post-Chorus]
Almost home, almost home
[Bridge]
I know that the cross has brought Heaven to us
But make no mistake, there's still more to come
When our flesh and our bone are no longer between
Where we are right now and where we're meant to be
When all that's been lost is made whole again
When these tears and this pain no longer exist
No more walking, we're running as fast as we can
Consider this our second wind
[Chorus]
Almost home, brother, it won't be long
Soon all your burdens will be gone
With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free
Hold up your head, keep pressing on, we are almost home
[Post-Chorus]
Almost home, almost home
[Outro]
We are almost home, almost home, almost home
We are almost home

I've been thinking about time and where does it go
How can I stop my life from passing me by, I don't know
I've been thinking about family (Family), how it's going so fast
Will I wake up one morning, just wishing that I could go back?
I've been thinking about lately, maybe I could make a change
And then it could change me, so with all of my heart
This is my prayer
[Chorus]
Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Keep me in the moment, oh keep me in the moment
Keep me in the moment, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me
[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the morning, Lord touch my heart
Don't let me stray, I just wanna stay where You are
All I got is one shot, one try, one go around in this beautiful life
Nothing is wasted when everything's placed in Your hands
[Chorus]
Singing, Oh Lord keep me in the moment
Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (What You have for me)
Keep me in the moment (Keep me in the moment), oh keep me in the moment (Keep me in the moment)
Keep me in the moment, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me

I've been thinking about Heaven, and the promise You hold
So it's all eyes on You, until the day You call me home

Help me live with my eyes wide open
'Cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (I don't wanna miss, I don't wanna miss)
Singing, Oh Lord show me what matters
Throw away what I'm chasing after, 'cause I don't wanna miss what You have for me (Yeah)

This is the story of a runaway
With no way home and no way out
I threw the best of me away
I had my chance, it's too late now
Too far gone and too ashamed
To think that You'd still know my name
But love refused to let my story end that way
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst
Love moved first
Oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-ohh
[Verse 2]
What kind of grace, relentless grace
Would chase this rebel down
Crawl into this prisoner's cage
Take my hand and pull me out
You knew I couldn't make the change
So You became the change in me
And now I live to tell the story
Of the God who rescues
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst
Love moved first
[Bridge]
From the throne to the manger
From a manger to the grave
Your cross is the proof
Love made the first move
From a grave meant to keep You
To a stone rolled away
Your cross is the proof
Love made the first move
I remember where You found me
I'm amazed by where I stand
Your cross is the proof
That love made the first move
[Chorus]
You didn't wait for me to find my way to You
I couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to
You came running after me
When anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst

Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me

And if I'm honest, maybe I've blamed you too
But You would not forsake me

There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
[Verse 2]
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way, I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body and now that power lives in me
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)

I can see the light in the darkness, as the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens, as the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us, as the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us, nothing stands between us
[Verse 3]
There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
[Chorus]
There'll be another in the fire, standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, how good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle, 'cause I know that's where You'll be
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
'Cause there is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
I know that's what they say
But right now it seems this loneliness won't go away
Can anybody feel this heartache?
Is anyone around?
Feels like we're running 'round in circles
We can't catch a breath
We can't always enjoy the moment
When we always want what's next
Just when I can't take no more
It's when I hear You say
[Chorus]
Don't hang your head when you get lonely
No, I'll never leave your side
And don't go thinking you're the only
One that can't get it right
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love, love
Down in your soul
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love
And I won't let you go
[Verse 2]
I know there's nowhere I can run
There's nowhere I can hide
From the one who gave His life
So I could get back mine (Yeah)
So when you can't take no more
Look up and hear Him say
[Chorus]
Don't hang your head when you get lonely
No, I'll never leave your side
And don't go thinking you're the only—
One that can't get it right
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love, love
Down in your soul
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love
And I won't let you go
[Bridge]
Your mercy is new every morning
Your grace sustains all of my life
You are the one that I run to
In You I am satisfied
Oh
Your mercy is new every morning
Your grace sustains all of my life
You are the one that I run to
In You I am satisfied
[Chorus]
Don't hang your head when you get lonely
No, I'll never leave your side
And don't go thinking you're the only
One that can't get it right
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love, love
Down in your soul
Yeah, you got my love
Love, love
And I won't let you go

I walk a bit different now
Now that my heart's been found
Nothing really feels the same
I hold my head a bit higher
I lift my voice a bit louder
Yeah, something inside has changed
[Chorus]
I am a mountain mover, water walker
More than just an overcomer
'Cause I've been set free
I am a gospel preacher, heart on fire
Freedom singing, testifier
'Cause I've been redeemed
I am a believer
I am a believer
[Verse 2]

I know I don't walk alone
No matter what comes my way
I have peace through the trouble
I have joy though the struggle
And now my hope's in a brighter day

I am a mountain mover, water walker

An orphan, no longer
No doubt about who I am

I'm in the hands of the Healer
The arms of the Savior
His grace makes me who I am
[Chorus]
I am a mountain mover, water walker
More than just an overcomer
'Cause I've been set free, yeah
I am a mountain mover, water walker

90 miles on the highway
Every day moving so fast
Taking all the wrong ways out
Never saw You coming
Stopping me in my tracks
Keeping me from the long way down
[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter just how many times I try
There could only be a single reason why
So tell me
[Chorus]
How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
You can say the stars aligned but
I know that it's more than timing
How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me
Ooh, ooh

But I know that You did all that

In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the 
King of Kings
[Verse 2]
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
[Verse 3]
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
[Verse 4]
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
[Chorus]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Praise forever to the King of Kings

Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre
[Verse]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God
[Outro]
(
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Okay, okay, okay, okay

Right now I'm staring down a giant
Right now I can't see past my pain
And right now my songs have turned to silence
And You've never seemed so far away
[Pre-Chorus]
But I still believe
I still believe
[Chorus]
There's no heart You can't rescue
No war You can't win
No story so over
It can't start again
No pain You won't use
No wall You won't break through
It might be too much for me but
There is no impossible with You
[Verse 2]
Right now You're fighting all my battles
Right now You're breathing life again
And I know You're mighty in my weakness
So right now my soul will say amen
[Chorus]
There's no heart You can't rescue
No war You can't win
No story so over
It can't start again
No pain You won't use
No wall You won't break through
It might be too much for me but
There is no impossible with You
[Bridge]
Your name is greater
Your love is stronger
Your ways are higher
There's nothing that You can't do
'Cause there's no impossible with You
[Chorus]
Oh, there's no heart You can't rescue
No war You can't win
No story so over
It can't start again
No pain You won't use
No wall You won't break through
It might be too much for me but
There is no impossible with You

God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is
[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

I know this road is gettin' hard
I heard you say it's overwhelming
I said I'd never be too far
And I meant that from the heart
[Verse 2]
I see the mountain gettin' higher
I see it stackin' up against you
I always said you were a fighter
But you've got your doubts tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm here to remind you
It don't matter where you come from
I know we can get through this
It might feel it's been so long
But we keep on keepin' on (Keepin' on)
It might feel like an uphill climb
Always some kind of battle (Battle)
But you got more than you on your side

Some things will never be the same
Some things are only for a season (Season)
And just the thought of letting go
Well, it's brought you to your knees (To your knees, to your knees)

Oh, but if you can make it, you can make it through the ni-ight
I can promise that the sun is gonna ri-ise
You wake up just a little bit stronger
So hold on just a little bit longer

Venmo you another loan (Another loan)

Thought that you had time to straighten it out (Straighten it out)

Lie number one: You're supposed to have it all together
And when they ask how you're doing, just smile and tell them "Never better"
Lie number two: Everybody's life is perfect except yours
So keep your messes and your wounds and your secrets safe with you behind closed doors

I say, "I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine, oh, I'm fine, hey, I'm fine"
But I'm not, I'm broken
And when it's out of control, I say "It's under control"
But it's not and You know it
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it
When being honest is the only way to fix it
There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
So let the truth be told
[Verse 2]
There's a sign on the door, says, "Come as you are," but I doubt it
'Cause if we lived like that was true, every Sunday morning pew would be crowded
But didn't You say church should look more like a hospital?
A safe place for the sick, the sinner and the scarred, and the prodigals
Like me

Well truth be told, the truth is rarely told

There's no failure, no fall
There's no sin You don't already know
So let the truth be told

Can I really stand here unashamed
Knowing that Your love for me won't change?
Oh God, if that's really true
Then let the truth be told

My God is able to save
And deliver and heal
And restore anything that He wants to
Just ask the man
Who was thrown
On the bones of Elisha
If there’s anything that He can’t do
Just ask the stone
That was rolled
At the tomb in the garden
What happens when God says to move
I feel Him moving it now
I feel Him doing it now
I feel Him doing it now
Do it now, do it now

Every anxious thought that steals my breath
It's a heavy weight upon my chest
As I lie awake and wonder what the future will hold
Help me to remember that You're in control
[Chorus]
You're my courage when I worry in the dead of night
You're my strength 'cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight
You are greater than the battle raging in my mind
I will trust You, Lord, I will fear no more
[Verse 2]
I will lift my eyes, I will lift my cares
Lay them in Your hands, I'll leave them there
When the wind and waves are coming, You shelter me
Even though I'm in the storm, the storm is not in me
[Chorus]
You're my courage when I worry in the dead of night
You're my strength 'cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight
You are greater than the battle raging in my mind
I will trust You, Lord, I will fear no more
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh) I will fear no more
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh) I will fear no more

No power can come against me 'cause You have overcome
No darkness can overwhelm me 'cause You've already won

My weapon
My weapon
[Verse 1]
Let every lie be silenced and all depression cease
Let every dark assignment bow down at Jesus' feet
Let every curse be broken, let every storm be tamed
And all that come against us be bound in Jesus' name
[Chorus]
Your presence is my greatest weapon
Pushing back the darkness, breaking every chain
My worship opens up the Heavens
Crushing every stronghold when I speak Your name
'Cause Your presence is my weapon
Your presence is my weapon
[Post-Chorus]
My weapon
My weapon
[Verse 2]
Your strength will not be shaken, Your love will not back down
Death has been defeated, what can stop me now?
I hold on to what You've spoken, You said that I am free
You've given me Your promise and You are my victory
[Chorus]
Your presence is my greatest weapon
Pushing back the darkness, breaking every chain
My worship opens up the Heavens
Crushing every stronghold when I speak Your name
'Cause Your presence is my weapon
Your presence is my weapon
[Bridge]
Your word and a melody are making a way for me
You defeat the enemy
This prison is shaking now and these walls are coming down
Your presence makes me free (Oh, I am free, oh, I am free)
I am free (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
[Chorus]
Your presence is my greatest weapon
Pushing back the darkness, breaking every chain
My worship opens up the Heavens
Crushing every stronghold when I speak Your name

I've carried a burden for too long on my own
I wasn't created to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
You saw my condition, had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart
And I don't have a context for that kind of love
I don't understand, I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh…
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh… (Oh-ohh)
[Bridge]
My heart has been in Your sights
Long before my first breath
Running into Your arms
Is running to life from death
And I feel this rush deep in my chest
Your mercy is calling out
Just as I am You pull me in
And I know I need You now
[Chorus]
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
And my heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh…
Again and again and again and again (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Again and again

Scared, oh I thought I knew scared
But I’m so filled with fear
I can barely move
Doubt, I’ve had my share of doubt
But never more than right now
I’m wondering where are You
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here on the edge of fall apart
Somehow Your promises
Find my troubled heart
[Chorus]
This is the truth I’m standing on
Even when all my strength is gone
You are faithful forever
And I know You’ll never
Let me fall
Right now I’m choosing to believe
Someday soon I’ll look back and see
All the pain had a purpose
Your plan was perfect all along
This is the truth I’m standing on
[Verse 2]
Good, I believe You’re still good
Even when life’s not good
I will not lose this hope
[Pre-Chorus 2]
That the God who parts the sea
Promises He's gonna
Make a way for me

My rock my shield my firm foundation
I know I will not be shaken
You remind me
Where my help comes from

The devil thought he had a hold of me
He told so many lies that I believed
Got to weak to carry on
I thought that I was too far gone
But then I heard a voice from Calvary
And now I'm singing

I hit my knees and mercy floods my soul
And though the enemy is near
I'm not giving into fear
Cause You're the voice of truth that leads me home
So I'm singing...

No more shackles on my feet

Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God

If that's all the love you have, that's all you got
To sing of change

To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

We want our coffee in the lobby
We watch our worship on a screen
We got a Rockstar preacher
Who won't wake us from our dreams
We want out blessings in our pocket
We keep our missions overseas
But for the hurting in our cities
Would we even cross the street?
[Pre-Chorus]
Huh but we wanna see the heart set free and the tyrants kneel
The walls fall down and our land be healed
But church if we want to see a change in the world out there

It's got to start right here
It's got to start right now
Lord, I'm starting right here
Lord, I'm starting right now

Who turned his nose and puffed his chest
He didn't run off like his brother
But his soul was just as dead
What if the church on Sunday
Was still the church on Monday too?
What if we came down from our towers
And walked a mile in someone's shoes?
[Pre-Chorus]
Hmm 'cause we wanna see the heart set free and the tyrants kneel
The walls fall down and our land be healed
But church if we want to see a change in the world out there

If we'll surrender all our pride and turn from our ways
He will hear from Heaven and forgive our sin

If we'll surrender all our pride and turn from our ways
He will hear from Heaven and forgive our sin

Nothing can hold us back
Nothing can tear us apart
Not life, not death, not the in-between
This is just the start

Chasing down the dead of night
We're bringing hope to the streets

He's bringing sight back to the blind (To the blind)
Show the lame how to walk
And make the dead alive

He led me out of the desert
Brought me into His streams
River of living water
Turned my bitter into sweet
And all my burdens are lifted
You took the shackles off my feet
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no sound louder than a captive set free

So let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Sing of His promises ever more
Pour out your thankfulness, let it overflow
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so

There is joy in the morning
Springing up in my soul
There is life worth living
'Cause He calls me His own
And there's a hallelujah
After sweet victory

No‚ there's no sound louder than a captive set free

Thank God for the daylight, I spent a long time in the dark
Felt good saying "Goodbye", waking up to a brand new heart
And if you're sleeping like I used to be, in a grave that holds you tight
There's a Savior calling, mm, promising a brand new life, He's saying
[Chorus]
Wake up, sleeper, open your eyes
Oh, sinner, arise, leave your past at the door
Wake up, sleeper, come to the light
Christ is alive, death don't live here anymore
Death don't live here anymore
[Verse 2]
I bet you like that freedom, ooh, I bet you like your new name
Oh, welcome to the kingdom, yeah, we all feel that way (Mm-mm, mm)
So if you meet somebody sleeping like the way you used to be
Tell 'em bout the Savior, ayy, and a little thing called "Free"
Go ahead and say
[Chorus]
Wake up, sleeper, open your eyes
Oh, sinner, arise, leave your past at the door
Wake up, sleeper, come to the light
Christ is alive, death don't live here anymore

Rise up and come out of that grave
Rise up in that amazing grace
Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?
Come awake (Oh-oh-oh, oh)

Oh, sleeper, won't you come awake?

Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to—

Uh, stay on point, I've been tryna save my voice
But y'all gave me no choice
The world gone mad, can't ignore this noise
Look at these people found dead in the streets
I got some partners that hate the police
Me, I'm just tryna hold onto my peace
'Cause I'm liable to lose it and go get the piece (Yah)
I need a reason, I need a season
Pleaded with Jesus, all of this grievin'
They be like, "F you and what you believe in"
I do not trip, I keep it G
What in the H you sayin' to I? (I)
Ain't no JK when I'm talkin' to God (God)
Don't need a reason to open my eyes
If I'm still breathin', I'm runnin' for Ahmaud, man (Runnin' for Ahmaud)
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)
Deep end of this pit, but still somehow I keep on floating on
Thought I lost my grip, but God reminded me He's holding on
[Chorus: John Summit]
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end

Yeah, I might go crazy
I might go MJ back in the 80s
Back in the 90s, I might go off
Well, they better not try me, it might get dicey
I ain't tryna go back to the old me (Nah)
I'm tryna hang on like my mama told me
Sometimes legs get weak and your arms give out
And you sink to the bottom slowly (Sink to the bottom slow)
A grown man wishing that somebody hold me (Hold)
Never knew my daddy, so nobody showed me
Taught me how to walk through the storm when your heart feel heavy
And it's hard and you're feeling lonely
But lowkey, high priest got the keys to the kingdom
High key low enough to bring 'em
And I need all of what He's bringing
I might go off the deep end, I just need another reason, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before (Woo)
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)

Trying to be somebody I'm not but it's not what I want

I've stacking up the years I spent trading punches with the enemy
Built myself a double thick stone tower of lies, higher than the eye could see
Trapped in my flesh & bone
Crying out to You Lord, I’m desperate
Love come rattle this cage and set me free

Gotta come down, come down

Gotta come down, come down

Gotta come down, come down

Truth was crashing through the pride and the blame
Cutting straight to the heart of me
Long before I ever called your name
You were fighting for my victory
Carved in Your flesh and bone
The wounds that have said my souls forgiven
Oh now I can feel the darkness trembling

Miracles when You move
Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
[Pre-Chorus]
Right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
[Chorus]
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
[Verse 2]
Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like it's Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down
[Pre-Chorus]
But right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
[Chorus]
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will (Yes)
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
[Bridge]
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You never will (Oh, You never will)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
Never, never (You've never lost a battle)
So faithful
I know, I know, it's who You are
[Chorus]
You can do all (You can do all things)
You can do all things, all things but fail (You can do all things but fail)
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
I know, I know
You never will
You can do all (You can do all things)
There's nothing impossible for You
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
Yes, I know, oh, I know
You never will
I know, I know
You never will

I am surrounded
On every side, can't see the light of day
But I am persuaded
Beyond all hope, You won't let go of me
I stake my claim on every word You say
You will not be late

I will sing through ﬁre and thunder

The darkest of weather
Though I can't see, I still believe You're good
So I'm moving forward
Through crashing waves, I know I'm safe with You
You hold my life, You hear my cry
With every breath inside
[Chorus]
I will sing through ﬁre and thunder

And I will dwell in the hope of Your love forever
I am convinced that Your promises will hold together
And I will dwell in Your love

I was there the moment that it happened
But you couldn't see me through the pain
I caught every tear as they were falling
When you lost your heart that day
Yeah, you lost your heart that day
Now you only see through broken lenses
Trying to keep your head above the shame
You believe the lie that I am distant
But I hold you every day
Yeah, I hold you every day
[Chorus]
If you could see it through my eyes
You’d know that you are wanted
You'd know that you are wanted
And if you'd let my love inside
I’ll show you that you're wanted
I'll show you that you're wanted
[Verse 2]
You're more than all your darkest moments
You are defined by what I see
You're my reflection, you're my treasure, you're my heartbeat
Oh, child, you belong to me, ohh
[Chorus]
’Cause if you would see it through my eyes
You’d know that you are wanted
You'd know that you are wanted
And if you’d let my love inside
I'll show you that you're wanted
I'll show you that you’re wanted, oh
[Bridge]
Not rejected, not unwelcome
You're wanted (You're wanted)
Oh, you're wanted (You're wanted)
Not abandoned, not forgotten
You're wanted
Oh, you're wanted
[Verse 3]
I'm right here in this moment
And I'm singing over you
Yeah, I'm singing over you, oh
[Chorus]
If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know that you are wanted (You are wanted)
You'd know that you are wanted
And if you'd let my love inside
I'll show you that you're wanted
I'll show you that you're wanted

The sparrow's not worried ‘bout tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily’s not thinking ‘bout the seasons
The drought or the flood
A tree that's planted by the water
Isn't fazed by the fire
So why should I be?
[Chorus]
’Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me
[Verse 2]
The sun's not worried ‘bout the winter
‘Cause soon it will pass
The light's not thinking ‘bout the darkness
Or the shadow it casts
A heart that's planted in forgiveness
Doesn't dwell in the past
So why should I be?
[Chorus]
'Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me
[Bridge]
I know there must be more
But I can’t get past Your kindness
I know there’s got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness
I know there must be more
But I can’t get past Your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness
[Chorus]
You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Oh, You take good care of me

Oh, just one word, You calm the storm that surrounds me
Just one word, the darkness has to retreat
Oh, just one touch, I feel the presence of heaven
Just one touch, my eyes were opened to see

Waited for the ground to shake
I've searched the sky for something amazing
Remind me there's another way
[Pre-Chorus]
Just as marvelous
Still miraculous

I see You in the ordinary
Every breath I breathe

Nothing is mundane
Your glory is displayed
In a million ways
In the ordinary
You make my days
Extraordinary
In the ordinary

Or watching as the seasons' change
In a heart to heart conversation
And joy that can't be contained
